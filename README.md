# TextAge - Please refer Data_and_training.html if the ipynb file is not loading

This project is meant to provide a set of tools that help Historians, Philologists, and literature enthusiast predict the Age of a text using AI.

The model works on the principle that language chages over time and this change can act as a yard stick that allows us to predict when a piece of text was written.

This can be helpful in understanding previously neglected texts.
