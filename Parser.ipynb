Good sonne go forward in this gentle humor, \\nobserue this picture, it presents a maide of noble birth and \\nexcellent of parts, whom for our house and honor sake, I wish\\nthou wouldst confesse to marrie. To marrie father? why we shall haue children. Why that's the ende of marriage, and the ioye of\\nmen. O how you are deceiued, you haue but me, & what\\na trouble am I to your ioy? but father, if you long to haue\\nsome fruite of me, see father I will creepe into this stuborne\\nearth and mixe my flesh with it, and they shall breede\\ngrasse, to fat oxen, asses and such like, and when they in the\\ngrasse the spring conuerts into beasts nourishment, then\\ncomes the fruite of this my body forth; then may you well\\nsay, seeing my race is so profitably increased, that good fat \\noxe, and that same large eard asse are my sonne sonnes, that\\ncaulfe with a white face is his faire daughter, with which,\\nwhen your fields are richly filled, then will my race content\\nyou, but for the ioyes of children, tush tis gone, children\\nwill not deserue, nor parents take it: wealth is the onely\\nfather & the child, and but in wealth no man hath any ioy. Some course deare sonne take for thy honor sake. Then father heres a most excellent course. This is some comfort yet. If you will strait be gone and leaue me here, Ile\\nstand as quietlye as anye lambe, and trouble none of you An haplesse man. How like you this humour yet my liege? As of a holy fury, not a frensie. See see my liege, he hath seene vs sure. Nay looke how he viewes Martia and makes \\nhim fine. Yea my liege, and she as I hope wel obserued, hath\\nvttered many kind conceits of hers. Well Ile be gone, and when shee comes to \\nVerones ordinarie, Ile haue her taken to my custodie. Ile stay my liege, and see the euent of this. Do so Lemot . What haue I seene? howe am I burnt to dust\\nwith a new Sun, and made a nouell Phoenix, is she a \\nwoman that obiects this sight, able to worke the chaos of the\\nworld into gestion? O diuine aspect, the excellent disposer\\nof the mind shines in thy beautie, and thou hast not \\nchaunged my soule to sense but sense vnto my soule, and I desire\\nthy pure societie, but euen as angels do, to angels flie. Flie soule and follow him. I maruaile much at my sonnes sodaine straunge\\nbehauiour. Beare with him yet my Lord, tis but his humour:\\ncome, what shall we go to Verones ordinarie? Yea for Gods sake, for I am passing hungry. Yea, come Monsieur Lemot , will you walke? What, will you go? Yea sweet bird, I haue promised so. Go to, you shall not go and leaue me alone. For one meale gentle bird: Veron inuites vs to buy\\nsome iewels he hath brought of late from Italie : Ile buy the\\nbest, and bring it thee, so thou wilt let me go. Well said flattering Fabian , but tel me     \\nthen what\\nladies will be there? Ladies? why none. No ladies vse to come to ordinaries, Madam. Go to bird, tell me now the very truth. None of mine honour bird, you neuer heard that\\nladies came to ordinaries. O thats because I should not go with you. Why tis not fit you should. Well heark you bird, of my word you shall not go,\\n\\nvnlesse you will sweare to me, you will neither court nor\\nkisse a dame in any sort, till you come home againe. Why I sweare I will not. Go to, by this kisse. Yea, by this kisse. Martia , learne by this when you are a wife. I like the kissing well. My lord Ile leaue you, your sonne Dowsecer hath\\nmade me melancholy with his humour, and Ile go locke\\nmy selfe in my close walke till supper time. What, and not dine to day? No my good head: come Martia , you and I   \\nwill\\nfast togither. With all my heart Madam. Well Gentlemen Ile go see my sonne. Birlady Gentlemen Ile go home to dinner. Home to dinner? birlord but you shall not, you\\nshall go with vs to the ordinarie, where you shall meete\\nGentlemen of so good carriage, and passing co~plements, it\\nwill do your hart good to see them, why you neuer saw the\\nbest sort of Gentlemen if not at ordinaries. I promise you thats rare, my lord, and Monsieur \\nLemot , Ile meet you there presently. Weele expect your comming. Come on my maisters, shadow these tables with\\ntheir white vailes, accomplish the court Cupboord, waite\\ndiligently to day for my credite and your owne, that if the \\nmeate should chance to be raw, yet your behauiors being\\nneither rude nor raw, may excuse it, or if the meate should \\nchaunce to be tough, be you tender ouer them in your \\nattendance, that the one may beare with the other. Faith some of them bee so hard to please, finding\\nfault with your cheere, and discommending your wine,\\nsaying, they fare better at Verones for halfe the mony. Besides, if there be any cheboules in your napkins,\\nthey say your nose or ours haue dropt on them, and then\\nthey throw them about the house. But these bee small faultes, you may beare with\\nthem, young Gentlemen and wilde heades will be doing. Come, whose wit was it to couer in this roome, \\nname in the of God I trowee. Why I hope this roome is as faire as the other. In your foolish opinion: you might haue tolde a\\nwise body so, and kept your selfe a foole still. I cry you mercie, how bitter you are in your \\nprouerbs. So bitter I am sir. O sweet Sateena I dare not say I loue thee. Must you controule vs you proud baggage you? Baggage? you are a knaue to call me baggage. A knaue? my maister shall know that. I will not see them. Maister, here is your Maid vses her selfe so \\nsawsily, that one house shall not holde vs two long, God \\nwilling. Come hither huswife. Pardon mee sweete \\nIacenan , I must make an angry face outwardly, though I smile\\ninwardly. Say what you will to me sir. O you are a fine Gossip, can I not keepe honest\\nseruants in my house, but you must controule them? you\\nmust be their mistres. Why I did but take vp the cloth, because my \\nmistresse would haue the dinner in an other roome, and hee\\ncalled me baggage. You called me knaue and foole, I thanke you small \\nbones. Go to, go to, she were wise enough would talke\\nwith you. Go thy waies for the prowdest harlotrie that euer\\ncame in our house. Let her alone boy, I haue scoold her I warant thee,\\nshe shall not be my maide long, if I can helpe it. No, I thinke so sir, but what, shal I take vppe the\\ncloath? No, let the cloth lie, hither theile com first, I   \\nam sure\\nof it, then If they will dine in the other roome, they shal. Good morrow my host, is no body come yet? Your worship is the first sir. I was inuited by my cosen Colinet , to see your \\niewells. I thanke his worship and yours. Heres a prettie place for an ordinarie, I am very\\nsory I haue not vsed to come to ordinaries.

Good morrow to you sir, What are we two the first? giue's the cardes, here\\ncome, this gentleman and I wil go to cardes while dinner\\nbe ready. No truly I cannot play at cardes. How! not play, O for shame say not so, how can a \\nyong gentleman spend his time but in play, and in courting\\nhis Mistris: come vse this, least youth take too much of the \\nother. Faith I cannot play, and yet I care not so much\\n\\nto venture two or three crownes with you. O I thought what I shuld find of you, I pray God\\nI haue not met with my match. No trust me sir, I cannot play. Hearke you my host, haue you a pipe of good\\nTabacco? The best in the towne: boy drie a leafe. Theres none in the house sir. Drie a docke leafe. My host, do you know Monsieur Blanuel ? Yea passing well sir. Why, he was taken learning trickes at old Lucilas\\nhouse the muster mistris of all the smocktearers in Paris,\\nand both the bawde and the pander were carried to the\\ndungeon. There was dungeon vpon dungeon, but call you her\\nthe muster-mistris of al the smocktearers in Paris? Yea, for she hath them all trained vp afore her. Good morow my host, good morow gentlemen al. Good morow Monsieur Blanuel , I am glad of your \\nquicke deliuery. Deliuery, what didst thou thinke I was with child? Yea of a dungeon. Why, how knew you that? Why Berger told vs. Berger who told you of it? One that I heard, by the lord. O excellent, you are still playing the wagge. Good morrow Gentlemen all, good morrow good\\nMonsieur Rowle . At your seruice. I pray my lord look what a prety falling band he    \\nhath,\\ntis pretty fantasticall, as I haue seen made, with good \\niudgement, great shew, and but tittle cost. And so it is I promise you, who made it I\\npray? I know not yfaith, I bought it by chance. It is a very pretty one, make much of it. Boy, I prethee call for a course napkin. Good \\nmorrow Gentlemen, I would you had bin at the tenniscourt,\\nyou should haue seene me a beat Monsieur Besan , and I\\ngaue him fifteene and all his faults. Thou didst more for him, then euer God wil do for\\nthee. Iaques, I prethee fill me a cup of canary,      \\nthree parts\\nwater You shall haue all water and if it please you. Who cald for a course napkin? Marry I , sweete heart, do you take the paines to\\nbring it your selfe, haue at you by my hosts leaue. Away sir, fie for shame. Hearke you my host, you must marry this young\\nwench, you do her mighty wrong els. O sir, you are a merry man. Good morrow gentlemen, you see I am as good as\\nmy word. You are sir, and I am very glad of it. You are welcome Monsieur Foyes : but you are not,\\nno not you. No, welcome that Gentleman, tis no matter for me. How sir? no matter to you, by this rush I am    \\nangry\\nwith you, as if al our loues protested vnto you were \\ndissembled, no matter for you? Nay sweet Lemot be not angry, I did but iest,   \\nas I am \\na Gentleman. Yea but theres a difference of iesting, you wrong\\nall our affections in so doing. Faith and troth I did not, and I hope sirs you take \\nit\\nnot so. No matter for me, twas very vnkindly sayd, I must\\nneeds say so. You see how they loue me. I do sir, and I am very glad of it. And I hope Lemot , you are not angry with me    \\nstil. No faith, I am not so very a foole to be angry with\\none that cares not for me. Do not I care for you? nay then. What, dost thou cry? Nay I do not cry, but my stomacke waters to thinke\\nthat you should take it so heauily, if I do not wish that I\\nwere cut into three peeces, and that these peeces were \\nturned into three blacke puddings, and that these three blacke\\npuddings were turned into three of the fairest Ladies in the\\nland for your sake, I would I were hanged, what a diuel can\\nyou haue more then my poore heart? Well harke you Lemot , in good faith you are too\\nblame to put him to this vnkindnes, I prethee be friends\\nwith him. Well, I am content to put vp this vnkindnesse for\\nthis once, but while you liue take heede of: no matter for \\nme. Why is it such a hainous word? O the hainousest word in the world. Wel, Ile neuer speake it more, as I am a gentleman. No I pray do not. My lord, will your lordship go to cards? Yea with you Monsieur Foyes . Lemot , will you play? Pardon good Monsieur Rowle , if I had any \\ndisposition to gaming your company should draw me before\\nany mans here. Labesha , what will you play? Play, yea with all my heart, I pray lend me    \\nthree\\npence. Ile play no more. Why, haue you wonne or lost? Faith I haue lost two or three crownes. Well to him againe, Ile be your halfe. Sirrah, Catalian , while they are playing at   \\ncardes,\\nthou and I will haue some excellent sport: sirrah, dost thou\\nknow that same Gentleman there? No yfaith, what is he? A very fine gull, and a neat reueller, one thats   \\nheire\\nto a great liuing, yet his father keepes him so short, that his\\nshirts will scant couer the bottom of his belly, for all his gay\\noutside, but the linings be very foule and sweatie, yea and\\nperhappes lowsie, with dispising the vaine shiftes of the\\nworld. But he hath gotten good store of money now me\\nthinks. Yea, and I wonder of it, some ancient seruing man\\nof his fathers, that hath gotten fortie shillings in fiftie years\\nvpon his great good husbandrie, he swearing monstrous\\nothes to pay him againe, and besides to doe him a good\\nturne (when God shall heare his prayer for his father) hath\\nlent it him I warrant you, but howsoeuer, we must speake\\nhim faire. O what else! God saue sweete Monsieur Rowle , what loose or \\nwin, loose or win? Faith sir saue my selfe, and loose my money. Theres a prouerbe hit dead in the necke like a \\nCony, why hearke thee Catalian , I could haue told thee \\nbefore what he would haue said. I do not thinke so. No, thou seest heers a fine plumpe of gallants, such\\nas thinke their wits singular, and their selues rarely \\n\\naccomplished, yet to shew thee how brittle their wittes be, I will \\nspeake to them seuerally, and I will tell thee before what \\nthey shall answer me. Thats excellent, lets see that yfaith. Whatsoeuer I say to Monsieur Rowlee , he shall\\nsay, O sir, you may see an ill weed growes apace. Come, lets see. Now Monsieur Rowlee , me thinks you are \\nexceedingly growne since your comming to Paris. O sir, you may see an ill weed growes a pace. This is excellent, forward sir I pray. What soere I say to Labesha , he shall answer  \\nme,\\nblacke will beare no other hue, and that same olde Iustice,\\nas greedie of a stale prouerbe, he shall come in the necke\\nof that and say, Blacke is a pearle in a womans eye. Yea, much yfayth. Looke thee, here comes hither Labesha ,        \\nCatalian ,\\nand I haue beene talking of thy complexion, and I say, that\\nall the faire ladies in France would haue beene in loue with\\nthee, but that thou art so blacke. O sir blacke will beare no other hue. O sir blacke is a pearle in a womans eye. You say true sir, you say true sir, sirrah         \\nCatalian ,\\nwhatsoere I say to Berger that is so busie at Cardes, he shall\\nanswer me, sblood, I do not meane to die as long as I can \\nsee one aliue. Come let vs see you. Why Berger , I thought thou hadst beene dead,  \\nI\\nhaue not heard thee chide all this while. Sblood, I do not meane to die, as long as I can see\\none aliue. Why but hearke you Lemot , I hope you cannot \\nmake this lord answer so roundly. O, as right as any of them all, and he shall \\naunswere mee with an olde Latine Prouerbe, that is, \\n vsus promptus facit  . Once more lets see. My lord, your lordship could not play at this game\\nverie latelie, and nowe me thinkes you are growne \\nexceeding perfite. O sir, you may see,  vsus promptus facit  . Monsieur Lemot , here is a Gentleman and two\\nGentlewomen do desire to speake with you. What are they come? Iaques , conuey them into\\nthe inwarde Parlour by the inwarde roome, and there is a \\nbrace of Crownes for thy labour, but let no bodie know of\\ntheir being here. I warrant you sir. See where they come: welcome my good lord and\\nladies, Ile come to you presently: so, now the sport begins,\\nI shall starte the disguised King plaguilie, nay I shall put\\nthe ladie that loues me in a monstrous fright, when her \\nhusband comes and finds her here. The Gentleman, and the two Gentlewomen \\ndesires your companie. Ile come to them presently. Gentlemen, Ile go speake with one, and come to\\nyou presently. My lord, I would speake a worde with your \\nlordship, if it were not for interrupting your game. No, I haue done Lemot . My lord there must a couple of ladies dine with\\nvs to day. Ladies? Gods my life I must be gone. Why, hearke you my Lorde, I knewe not of\\ntheir comming I protest to your Lordship, and woulde\\nyou haue mee turne such faire Ladies as these are \\naway? Yea but hearke you Lemot , did not you heare \\nmee sweare to my Wife, that I woulde not tarie, if there\\n\\nwere any women, I wonder you would suffer any to come\\nthere. Why you swore but by a kisse, and kisses are no\\nholie things, you know that. Why but hearke you Lemot , indeed I would be\\nvery loath to do any thing, that if my wife should know it,\\nshould displease her. Nay then you are to obsequious, hearke you, let me\\nintreate you, and Ile tell you in secrete, you shall haue no\\nworse company then the Kings. Why will the King be there? Yea, though disguised. Who are the ladies? The flowers of Paris, I can tell you, faire        \\ncountesse\\nFlorila , and the ladie Martia . Monsieur Lemot , the gentleman and the two \\nGentlewomen desire your companie. Ile come to them straight: but Iaques come     \\nhither\\nI prethee, go to Labesha , and tell him that the Countesse\\nFlorila , and the ladie Martia be here at thy maisters house:\\nand if it come in question hereafter, denie that thou tolde\\nhim any such thing. What, is this all? Sblood Ile denie it, and        \\nforsweare\\nit too. My Lorde, Ile goe and see the roome be neate\\nand fine, and come to you presently. Yea but hearke you Lemot , I prethee take such\\norder that they be not knowne of any women in the house. O how shuld they now to his wife go yfaith! Hearke you, Monsieur Labesha , I pray let me   \\nspeak\\na worde with you. With all my heart, I pray looke to my stake, theres\\nthree pence vnder the Candlesticke. I pray see, do you know the Countesse              \\nFlorila , and \\nthe ladie Martia ? Do I know the ladie Martia ? I knew her before\\nshe was borne, why do you aske me? Why, they are both here at my masters house. What, is Mistris Martia at an ordinarie? Yea that she is. By skies and stones Ile go and tel her father. What you are out of breath me thinks Monsieur\\nLemot ? It is no matter Madam, it is spent in your seruice,  \\nthat\\nbeare your age with your honesty, better then an hundred\\nof these nise gallants, and indeed it is a shame for your \\nhusband, that contrary to his oath made to you before dinner,\\nhe shoud be now at the ordinary with that light huswife\\nMartia , which I could not chuse but come and tell you; for\\nindeede it is a shame that your motherly care should be so\\nslightly regarded. Out on thee strumpet and accurst, and miserable\\ndame. Well, there they are: nothing els now, to her\\nhusband go I. Nothing els quoth you, can there be more? O \\nwicked man, would he play false, that would so simply vow,\\nand sweare his faith, and would not let me be displeased a\\nminute, but he would sigh, and weepe til I were pleased, I\\nhaue a knife within thats rasor sharp, and I wil lay an yron\\nin the fire, making it burning hot to mark the strumpet, but\\nt'will bee colde too ere I can come thither, doe something\\nwretched woman, staies thou here? My lorde, the roome is neate and fine, wilt please\\nyou go in? Gentlemen, your dinner is ready. And we are ready for it. Iaquis , shut the doores let no body come in. Where be these puritanes, these murderers, let me\\ncome in here? Where is the strumpet? where is this harlot, let vs come in here. What shall we do? the streets do wonder at vs, and\\nwe do make our shame knowne to the world, let vs go, and\\ncomplaine vs to the King. Come Labesha , will you go? No no I scorne to go; no King shal heare my plaint,\\nI will in silent liue a man forlorne, mad, and melancholy, as\\na cat, and neuer more weare hat band on my hat. What dost thou meane? thou must not hang on\\nme. O good lord Moren , haue me home with you,\\nyou may excuse all to my father for me. O my lord, be not so rude to leaue her now. Alas man, and if my wife should see it, I were \\nvndone. Pursue them sirs, and taking Martia from him, \\nconuay her presently to Valeres house.\\n   What vilain was it that hath vttered this? Why twas euen I, I thanke you for your gentle\\ntearmes, you giue me vilain at the first, I wonder wheres\\nthis old doter, what doth he thinke we feare him. O monstrous man, what, wouldst thou haue him \\ntake vs? Would I quoth you, yea by my troth would I, I know\\nhe is but gone to cal the constable, or to raise the streets. What meanes the man trow? is he mad? No, no, I know what I do, I doe it of purpose, I\\nlong to see him come and raile at you, to call you harlot,\\nand to spurne you too, O you'l loue me a great deale the\\nbetter, and yet let him come, and if he touch but one thread\\nof you, Ile make that thread his poyson. I know not what to say. Speake, do you loue me? Yea surely do I. Why then haue not I reason that loue you so \\ndearely as I do, to make you hatefull in his sight, that I might\\nmore freely enioy you. Why let vs be gon my kind Lemot , and not be\\nwondered at in the open streets. Ile go with you through fire, through death, throgh\\nhell, come giue me your owne hand, my owne deare heart,\\nthis hand that I adore and reuerence, and loath to haue it,\\ntouch an olde mans bosome, O let me sweetely kisse it; Out on thee wretch, he hath bit me to the bone,\\nO barbarous Canibal, now I perceiue thou wilt make me a \\nmocking stocke to all the world. Come, come, leaue your passions, they cannot\\nmooue mee, my father and my mother died both in a day,\\nand I rung mee a peale for them, and they were no \\nsooner brought to the church and laide in their graues, but I\\nfetcht me two or three fine capers aloft, and took my leaue\\nof them, as men do of their mistresses at the ending of a \\ngaliard;  Besilos manus  . O brutish nature, how accurst was I euer to indure\\nthe sound of this damned voice? Well, and you do not like my humor, I can be but\\nsory for it, I bit you for good will, and if you accept it, so, if\\nno, go. Vilain, thou didst it in contempt of me. Well, and you take it so, so be it: harke you Madam,\\nyour wisest course is, euen to become puritane againe, put\\noff this vaine attire, and say, I haue despised all: thanks my\\nGod, good husband, I do loue thee in the Lord, and he\\n(good man) will thinke all this you haue done, was but to\\nshew thou couldest gouerne the world, and hide thee as a \\nrainebow doth a storme: my dainty wench, go go, what\\nshall the flattering words of a vaine man make you forget\\nyour dutie to your husband? away, repent, amend your life,\\nyou haue discredited your religion for euer. Well wench, for this foule shame thou puttest on\\nme, the curse of all affection light on thee. Go Abacuck , go, why this is excellent, I shal \\nshortly become a schoolemaster, to whom men will put their\\nwiues, to practise; well now wil I go set the Queene vpo~ the\\nKing, and tell her where he is close with his wench: and he\\nthat mends my humor, take the spurres: sit fast, for by \\nheauen, ile iurke the horse you ride on. Well Gentlemen, I am vtterly vndone without\\nyour good helpes, it is reported that I receiued certaine \\nladies or gentlewomen into my house: no heres my man, my\\nmaid, and my boy, now if you saw any, speak boldly before\\nthese Gentlemen. I saw none sir. Nor I, by my maidenhead. Nor I, as I am a man. Wel my host, weele go answere for your house at\\nthis time, but if at other times you haue had wenches, and\\nwould not let vs know it, we are the lesse beholding to you. Peraduenture the more beholding to him, but\\nI laye my life Lemot hath deuised some ieast, he gaue\\n\\nvs the slip before dinner. Well Gentlemen, since we are so fitly mette, Ile   \\ntell\\nyou an excellent subiect for a fit of myrth, and if it bee well\\nhandled. Why, what is it? Why man, Labesha is grown maruelous \\nmalecontent, vpon some amorous disposition of his mistres, and\\nyou know he loues a mease of cream, and a spice-cake with\\nhis heart, and I am sure he hath not dined to day, and he hath\\ntaken on him the humour of the yong lord Dowsecer , and\\nwe will set a mease of creame, a spice-cake, and a spoone,\\nas the armour, picture, and apparell was set in the way of\\nDowsecer , which I doubt not but will woorke a rare cure\\nvpon his melancholie. Why, this is excellent, Ile go fetch the creame. And I the cake. And I the spoone. See where hee comes as like the lord Dowsecer as\\nmay be, nowe you shall heare him begin with some Latin\\nsentence that hee hath remembred euer since hee read his\\nAccidence. Faelix que~ faciunt aliena pericula            \\ncautum.  O sillie state\\nof things, for things they be that cause this sillie state: and\\nwhat is a thing, a bable, a toy, that stands men in small stead: but what haue we here? what vanities  \\nhaue we here? He is strongly tempted, the lord strengthen him,\\nsee what a vaine he hath. O cruell fortune, and dost thou spit thy spite at my\\npoore life: but O sowre creame what thinkest thou that I\\nloue thee still? no, no, faire and sweete is my mistries, if thou\\nhaddest strawberries and sugar in thee: but it may bee thou\\nart set with stale cake to choke me: well taste it, and trie it,\\nspoonefull by spoonefull: bitterer and bitterer still, but O\\nsowre creame, wert thou an Onion, since Fortune set thee\\n\\nfor mee, I will eate thee, and I will deuour thee in spite of\\nFortunes spite, choake I, or burst I, mistres for thy sake, to\\nend my life eate I this creame and cake. So he hath done, his Melancholy is well eased I \\nwarrant you. Gods my life Gentlemen, who hath beene at this \\ncreame? Creame, had you creame? where is your creame?\\nIle spend my penny at your creame. Why, did not you eate this creame? Talke not to me of creame, for such vaine meate I \\ndo despise as food, my stomack dies drowned in the cream\\nboules of my mistres eyes. Nay stay Labesha . No not I, not I. O he is ashamed yfayth: but I will tell thee howe\\nthou shalt make him mad indeed, say his mistres for loue\\nof him hath drowned her selfe. Sblood, that will make him hang himselfe. haue at them yfayth with a lame counterfeite\\nhumor: ake on rude arme, I care not for thy paine, I got it\\nnobly in the kings defence, and in the gardiance of my faire\\nQueenes right. O tell me sweet Lemot , how fares the king? or  \\nwhat\\nhis right was that thou didst defend? That you shall know when other things are told. Keepe not the Queene too long without her\\nlonging. No, for I tell you it is a daungerous thing. Little care cruell men how women long. What would you haue me then put poyson in my\\nbreath, and burne the eares of my attentiue Queene. Tell me what ere it be, Ile beare it all. beare with my rudenesse then in telling it, for alas\\nyou see I can but act it with the left hande, this is my \\ngesture now. Tis well enough. Yea well enough you say, this recompence\\nhaue I for all my woundes: then thus the King \\ninamoured of an other ladie compares your face to hers, and saies\\nthat yours is fat and flat, and that your neather lip was \\npassing big. O wicked man, doth he so sodainlie condemne\\nmy beautie, that when he married me he thought diuine:\\nfor euer blasted be that strumpets face, as all my hopes are\\nblasted, that did change them. Nay Madam, though he saide your face was fat,\\nand flat, and so forth, yet he liked it best, and said, a perfect\\nbeautie should be so. O did he so! why that was right euen as it should be. You see now Madam, howe much too hastie you\\nwere in your griefes. If he did so esteeme of me indeed, happie am I. So may your highnesse be that hath so good a \\nhusband, but hell hath no plague to such an one as I. Indeed Madam, you haue a bad husband: truly\\nthen did the king growe mightily in loue with the other \\nladie, and swore, no king could more inriched be, then to \\ninioy so faire a dame as shee. O monstrous man, and acurst most miserable dame! But saies the king I do inioy as faire, & though I  \\nloue\\nin al honored sort, yet Ile not wro~g my wife for al the world This proues his constancie as firme as brasse. It doth, it doth: O pardon me my lord, that I \\nmistake thy royall meaning so. In heauen your highnesse liues, but I in hell. But when he vewd her radient eyes againe, blinde\\nwas hee strooken with her feruent beames: and now good\\n\\nKing he gropes about in corners voide of the chearefull\\nlight should guide vs all. O dismall newes, what is my soueraigne blind? Blind as a Beetle madam, that a while houering \\naloft, at last in cowsheds fall. Could her eyes blind him? Eyes or what it was I know not, but blind I am\\nsure he is as any stone. Come bring me to my Prince my lord that I may\\nleade him, none aliue but I may haue the honour to direct\\nhis feete. How lead him madam? why hee can go as right\\nas you, or any here, and is not blind of eyesight. Of what then? Of reason. Why thou saidest he wanted his cheerfull light. Of reason still I meant, whose light you knowe\\nshould cheerefully guide a worthie King, for he doth loue\\nher, and hath forced her into a priuate roome where now\\nthey are. What mocking chaunges is there in thy wordes\\nfond man, thou murtherest me with these exclaimes. Why madam tis your fault, you cut mee off \\nbefore my words be halfe done. Forth and vnlade the poyson of thy tongue. Another lord did loue this curious ladie, who \\nhearing that the King had forced her, as she was walking with\\nanother Earle, ran straightwaies mad for her, and with a \\nfriend of his, and two or three blacke ruffians more, brake\\ndesperately vpon the person of the King, swearing to take\\nfrom him, in traiterous fashion, the instrument of \\nprocreation: with them I fought a while, TWO COMMAS IN SOURCE      \\nTEXT and got this wound, but\\nbeing vnable to resist so many, came straight to you to fetch\\nyou to his ayde. Why raised you not the streetes? That I forbore, because I would not haue the\\n\\nworld, to see what a disgrace my liege was subiect to, being\\nwith a woman in so meane a house. Whose daughter was it that he forst I pray? Your daughter sir. Whose sonne was that ranne so mad for her? Your sonne my lord. O Gods, and fiends forbid. I pray sir, from whom did he take the Ladie? From your good Lord. O Lord I beseech thee no. Tis all too true, come follow the Queen and I, where\\nI shall leade you. O wretched Queene, what would they take from\\nhim? The instrument of procreation. Now was there euer man so much accurst, that\\nwhen his minde misgaue him, such a man was haplesse, to\\nkeep him company? yet who would keep him company\\nbut I, O vilde Lemot , my wife and I are bound to curse thee\\nwhile we liue, but chiefely I, well: seeke her, or seek her not;\\nfind her, or find her not, I were as good see how hell opens,\\nas looke vpon her. We haue yfaith, stop thou him there, and I wil meet\\nhim here. Well, I will venture once to seek her. Gods Lord, my Lord, come you this way, why\\nyour wife runnes ranging like as if she were mad, swearing\\nto slit your nose if she can catch you. What shal I do at the sight of her and hern. Gods precious my Lord, come you this way, your\\nwife comes ranging with a troope of dames, like Bacchus\\ndrunken foes, iust as you go, shift for your selfe my Lord. Stay good Catalian . No not I my Lord. How now Iaques, whats the newes? None but good my Lord. Why hast not seene my wife run round about the\\nstreets. Not I my Lorde, I come to you from my maister,\\nwho would pray you to speake to Lemot , that Lemot might\\nspeake to the King, that my masters lottery for his iewells\\nmay go forward, he hath made the rarest deuice that euer\\nyou heard, we haue fortune in it, and she our maide plaies,\\nand I, and my fellow carrie two torches, and our boy goes\\nbefore and speakes a speech, tis very fine yfaith sir. Sirra in this thou maiest highly pleasure me, let me\\nhaue thy place to beare a torch, that I may look on my wife, \\nand she not see me, for if I come into her sight abruptly, I\\nwere better be hanged. O sir you shall, or any thing that I can do, Ile send\\nfor your wife to. I prethee do. This is the house where the mad Lord did vow to do\\nthe deed, draw all your swoords couragious gentlemen, Ile\\nbring you there where you shall honor win, but I can tell\\nyou, you must breake your shinne. Who will not breake his necke to saue his King: set\\nforward Lemot . Yea, much good can I do with a wounded arme,\\nIle go and call more helpe. Others shall go, nay we will raise the streets,     \\nbetter\\ndishonor, then destroy the King. Sbloud I know not how to excuse my villany, I \\nwould faine be gone. Ile geld the adulterous goate, and take from him\\nthe instrument, that plaies him such sweete musicke. O rare, this makes my fiction true: now ile stay. Arrest these faithlesse traitrous gentlemen. What is the reason that you call vs traitours? Nay, why do you attempt such violence against\\nthe person of the King? Against the King, why this is strange to me. How now my masters, what? weapons drawne, come\\nyou to murder me. How fares my Lord? How fare I? well, but you yfaith shall get me speak\\nfor you another time; he got me here to wooe a curious\\nLady, and she temptes him, say what I can, ouer what\\nstate I will in your behalfe Lemot , she will not yeeld. Yfaith my liege, what a hard heart hath she, well\\nhearke you, I am content your wit shall saue your honesty\\nfor this once. Peace, a plague on you, peace; but wherefore asked\\nyou how I did? Because I feared that you were hurte my\\nLord. Hurt, how I pray? Why, hurt Madam, I am well againe. Do you aske? why he told me Dowsecer and this\\nhis friend, threatned to take away. To take away, what should they take away. Name it Madam. Nay, I pray name it you. Why then, thus it was my liege, I told her \\nDowsecer , and this his friende threatned to take away, and \\nif they could the instrument SOURCE TEXT: iustrument of          \\nprocreation, and what\\nwas that now, but Martia beeing a fayre woman, is \\nnot shee the instrument of procreation, as all women \\nare. O wicked man. Go to, go to, you are one of those fiddles too      \\nyfaith. Well pardon my minion, that hath frayd you thus,\\ntwas but to make you mery in the end. I ioy it endes so well, my gracious Lord. But say my gracious Lord, is no harme done, \\nbetweene my louing daughter, and your grace? No, of my honor and my soule Foyes . The fire of loue which she hath kindled in me \\nbeing greater then my heate of vanity, hath quite expelled. Come Dowsecer , receiue with your lost wittes   \\nyour\\nloue, though lost; I know youle yeeld, my lord and you her\\nfather. Most ioyfully my Lord. And for her part I know her dispositio~ well enough. What, will you haue her? Yea mary will I. Ile go and tell Labesha presently. Monsieur Lemot , I pray let me speake with you, I\\ncome to you from the Lord Moren , who would desire you\\nto speake to the King for my masters lottery, and he hath\\nmy place to beare a torch, for bare faced hee dares not look\\nvpon his wife, for his life. O excellent, Ile further thy masters lottery and it \\nbe\\nbut for this iest only, harke you my liege, heres the poore\\nman hath bin at great charges for the preparation of a \\nlottery, and he hath made the rarest deuice, that I know you wil\\ntake great pleasure in it, I pray let him present it before you\\nat Valeres house. Whith all my heart, can you be ready so soone? Presently and if it like your grace. But hearke you Lemot , how shall we do for euery\\nmans posie. Will you all trust me with the making of them? With all our hearts. Why then Ile go to make the poses and bring \\nLabesha to the lottery presently. Surely the world is full of vanitie, a woman must  \\ntake\\nheed she do not heare a lewd man speake, for euery woman\\ncannot when shee is tempted, when the wicked fiend gets\\nher into his snares escape like me, for graces measure is not\\nso filled vp, nor so prest downe in euery one as me, but yet I\\npromise you a little more: well, Ile go seeke my head, who\\nshal take me in the gates of his kind armes vntoucht of any. What Madam are you so pure now? Yea, would not you be pure? No puritane. You must be then a diuell, I can tell you. O wife where hast thou beene? where did I tell you I would be I pray. In thy close walke thou saidst. And was I not? Truly I know not, I neither looked nor knocked,\\nfor Labesha told me that you, and faire Martia were at \\nVerones ordinarie. Labesha ? my lord you are a wise man to beleeue  \\na fool. Well my good head, for my part I forgiue you: but\\nsurely you do much offend to be suspicious: where there is\\nno trust, there is no loue, and where there is no loue twixt\\nman and wife, theres no good dealing surely: for as men\\nshould euer loue their wiues, so should they euer trust the~,\\nfor what loue is there where there is no trust? She tels you true, my lord. Shee doth my liege; and deare wife pardon this\\nand I will neuer be suspicious more. Why I say, I do. Looke you my liege, I haue done simple seruice\\namongest you, here is one had hanged himselfe for loue,\\nthinking his Mistresse had done so for him: well, see your\\nMistresse liues. And doth my Mistresse liue? Shee doth, O noble knight, but not your \\nMistresse now. Sblood, but she shall for me, or for no body else. How now, what a traitor, draw vpon the King. Yea, or vpon any woman here in a good cause. Well sweete Besha let her marry               \\nDowsecer , Ile get\\nthee a wife worth fifteene of her, wilt thou haue one that\\ncares not for thee? Not I by the Lord, I scorne her, Ile haue her better\\nif I can get her. Why thats well said. What Madam, are you turned puritan againe? When was I other, pray? Marie Ile tell you when, when you went to the\\nOrdinarie, and when you made false signes to your \\nhusband, which I could tell him all. Cursed be he that maketh debate twixt man & wife. O rare scripturian! you haue sealed vp my lips, a \\nhall, a hall, the pageant of the Butterie. What is he? This is Verones sonne, my liege. What shall he do? Speak some speach that his father hath made for him Why is he good at speeches? O he is rare at speaches. Faire ladies most tender, and nobles most slender,\\nand gentles whose wits be scarce. My host, why do you call vs nobles most slender? And it shall please your Grace, to be slender is  \\nto be\\nproper, and therfore where my boy saies nobles most \\nslender, it is as much to say, fine and proper nobles. Yea, but why do you call vs gentles whose wits are \\nscarce. To be scarce, is to be rare: and therefore where as\\nhe sayes Gentles whose wits be scarce, is as much as to say,\\nGentles whose wits be rare. Well, forwards trunchman. Faire ladies most tender, and nobles most slender,\\nand gentles whose wittes bee scarce, Queene Fortune\\ndoth come with her trumpe, and her drumme, as it may \\nappeare by my voice. Come hither, are you a schoolemaister, where was\\nFortune Queene, of what countrey or kingdome? Wy sir, Fortune was Queene ouer all the world. Thats a lie, theres none that euer conquered all the\\nworld, but maister Alisander , I am sure of that. O rare Monsieur Labesha , who would haue thought\\nhee could haue found so rare a fault in the speach. Ile alter it if it please your grace. No, tis very well. Father I must begin againe they interrupt me so. I beseech your grace giue the boy leaue to begin    \\nagain. With all my heart, tis so good we cannot heare\\nit too oft. Faire ladies most tender, and nobles most slender,\\nand gentles whose wittes are scarce, Queene Fortune doth\\ncome with her Fife, and her Drum, as it doth appeare by\\nmy voice, here is Fortune good, but il by the rood, and this\\nnaught but good shall do you, dealing the lots out of our\\npots, and so good Fortune to you sir. Looke you my liege, how hee that caries the torch\\ntrembles extreamly. I warrant tis with care to carie his torch well. Nay there is something else in the wind: why my\\nhost, what meanes thy man Iaques to tremble so? Hold still thou knaue, what art thou afraid to    \\nlooke\\nvpon the goodly presence of a king: hold vp for shame. Alas poore man, he thinks tis Iaques his man:  \\npoore\\nlord, how much is he bound to suffer for his wife? Hearke you mine host, what goodly person is that?\\nis it Fortune her selfe? Ile tell your Maiestie in secrete who it is, it   \\nis my \\nmaide Iaquena . I promise you she becomes her state rarely. Well my liege, you were all content that I should\\nmake your poses: well here they be euery one: giue \\nMaster Verone his fiue crownes. Theres mine and SOURCE TEXT: aud the Queenes. Theirs ours. And there is mine and Martias . Come Labesha thy money. You must lend me some, for my boy is runne away\\nwith my purse. Thy boy? I neuer knew any that thou hadst. Had not I a boy three or foure yeares ago, and he\\nran away. And neuer since he went thou hadst not a peny,\\nbut stand by, Ile excuse you. But sirrah Catalian , thou shalt\\nstand on one side and reade the prises, and I will stand on\\nthe other and read the Poses. Content Lemot . Come on Queene Fortune, tell euery man his\\nposie, this is orderly, the King and Queene are first. Come let vs see what goodly poses you haue \\ngiuen vs. This is your Maiesties, At the fairest, so it bee  \\nnot\\nMartia . A plague vpon you, you are still playing the \\nvillaines with me.

Why how can that be, there is no such coyne. Here is the worth of it, if it please your grace. Well, whats for me? A heart of gold. A goodly iewell, Count Laberuele and Florila .

Blanke for my lord Laberuele , for his wife a   \\nposie, a\\na SO IN SOURCE TEXT paire of holy beades with a crucifix. O bommination Idole, Ile none of them. Keepe them thy selfe Veron, she will not haue them. Dowsecer and Martia , I haue fitted your    \\nlordship for\\na posie. Why what is it? Ante omnia vna. And what is mine sir? A serious one I warrant you, change for the better. Thats not amisse. A prize: Dowsecer hath a cats eyes, or          \\nMercuries rod\\nof gold, set with Iacinths and Emeraldes. What is for Martia ? Martia hath the two serpents heads set with     \\ndiamonds. What my host Verone ? What? is he in for his owne iewells?

No faith you need not now, you haue plaid your\\nbellie full alreadie. Stand still good Iaquena , they do but ieast. Yea, but I like no such ieasting. Come great Queene Fortune, let see your posies,\\nwhat madam, alas, your ladiship is one of the last. What is my posie sir I pray? Marie Madame your posie is made in manner and\\nforme of an Eccho, as if you were seeking your husbande, and\\nfortune should be the Eccho, and this you say: where is my\\nhusbande hid so long vnmaskt? maskt, sayes the Eccho: but in\\nwhat place sweet Fortune? let me heare: heare, sayes the Eccho. There you lie Eccho, for if he were here we must\\nneedes see him. Indeed sweete King, there me thinkes the Eccho\\nmust needes lie, if hee were here, wee must needes see him, tis \\none of them that caries the torches: no that cannot be neither, \\nand yet by the Masse heres Iaques : why my host, did not you \\ntell me that Iaques should be a torchbearer? who is this?

Nay come your way, you may be well enough \\nashamed to shew your face that is a periured wretch, did not you \\nsweare, if there were any wenches at the ordinarie, you would \\nstraight come home?

I see Hephestion , that these Philosophers are\\nhere attending for vs. They were not Philosophers, if they knewe\\nnot their dueties. But I much meruaile Diogenes shoulde bee so\\ndogged. I do not think but his excuse wilbe better\\nthen Melippus message. I wil go see him Hephestion , because I long  \\nto\\nsee him that would commaunde Alexander to come, to\\nwhom all the world is like to come. Aristotle & the reste\\nsithence my comming from Thebes to Athens , from a\\nplace of conqueste to a pallace of quiet, I haue resolued\\nwith my self in my court to haue as many Philosophers\\nas I had in my camp soldiers. My court shalbe a schoole,\\nwherein I wil haue vsed as great doctrine in peace, as I \\ndid in warre discipline. We are al here ready to be commanded, & glad\\nwe are that we are commanded, for that nothing better\\nbecommeth kinges then literature, which maketh them\\ncome as neere to the Gods in wisdome, as they doe in\\ndignitie. It is so Aristotle , but yet there is among   \\nyou,\\nyea & of your bringing vp, that sought to destroy \\nAlexander , Calistenes , Aristotle , whose treasons      \\nagainste his\\nprince shall not bee borne out with the reasons of his\\nPhylosophy. If euer mischiefe entred into the hearte of\\nCalistenes , let Calistenes suffer for it, but that          \\nAristotle euer\\nimagined any such thing of Calistenes , Aristotle doth \\ndenie. Well Aristotle , kindred may blind thee, and\\naffection mee, but in kinges causes I will not stande to\\nschollers arguments. This meeting shalbe for a \\nco~mandement, that you all frequente my courte, instructe the\\nyoung with rules, confirme the olde with reasons: lette\\nyour liues be answerable to your learninges, leaste my\\nproceedinges be contrary to my promises. You sayde you woulde aske euerye one\\nof them a question, which yester night none of vs could\\naunswere. I will. Plato , of all beastes, which is the \\nsubtillest? That which man hetherto neuer knew. Aristotle , how should a man bee thought a    \\nGod? In doing a thing vnpossible for a man. Crisyppus , which was first, the day or the   \\nnight? The day by a day. In deede straunge questions must haue straung\\nanswers. Cleanthes , what say you, is life or death\\nthe stronger? Life, that suffereth so many troubles. Crates , how long should a man liue? Till he think it better to die then liue. Anaxarchus , whether doth the sea or the earth\\nbring forth most creatures? The earth, for the sea is but a parte of the\\nearth. Hephestion , me thinkes they haue answered all\\nwell, and in such questions I meane often to trye them. It is better to haue in your court a wise      \\nmanne,\\nthen in your ground a golden mine. Therefore would I\\nleaue war, to studie wisdome, were I Alexander . So would I, were I Hephestion . But come let  \\nvs go\\nand giue release, as I promised to our Theban\\nthralles. Thou art fortunate Aristotle , that           \\nAlexander is\\nthy scholler. And all you happy that he is your souereigne. I could like the man well, if he could be \\nconte~ted to be but a man. He seeketh to draw neere to the Gods in \\nknowledge, not to be a God. Let vs questio~ a litle with Diogines , why   \\nhe went\\nnot with vs to Alexander . Diogenes , thou didst forget thy\\nduetie, that thou wentst not with vs to the king. And you your profession, that you went to the\\nking. Thou takest as great pride to be peeuish, as \\nothers do glory to be vertuous. And thou as great honor being a Philosopher\\nto be thought courtlike, as others shame that be \\ncourtiers, to be accounted Philosophers. These austere maners set aside, it is wel known\\nthat thou didst counterfeit money. And thou thy manners, in that thou didst not\\ncounterfeit money. Thou hast reason to contemn the court, being\\nboth in bodye and minde too crooked for a \\ncourtier. As good bee crooked, and endeuour to make\\nmy selfe straight from the court, as to bee straighte, and\\nlearne to be crooked at the court. Thou thinkest it a grace to be opposite against\\nAlexander . And thou to be iumpe with Alexander . Let vs goe: for in co~temning him, we shal \\nbetter please him, then in wondring at him. Plato , what doest thou thinke of            \\nDiogenes ? To be Socrates furious, let vs goe. Behold Manes where thy maister is, seeking\\neither for bones for his dinner, or pinnes for his sleeues.\\nI will goe salute him. Doe so, but mum not a word that you sawe\\nManes . Then staye thou behinde, and I will goe with \\nPsyllus . All hayle Diogenes to your proper person. All hate to thy peeuish conditions. O Dogge. What dost thou seeke for here? For a man and a beast. That is easie without thy light to be founde,\\nbe not all these men? Called men. What beast is it thou lookest for? The beast my man Manes . He is a beast in deede that wil serue thee. So is he that begat thee. What wouldest thou do, if thou shuldest finde\\nManes ? Giue him leaue to doe as hee hath done \\nbeefore. Whats that? To runne away. Why, hast thou no neede of Manes ? It were a shame for Diogenes to haue neede of\\nManes , and for Manes to haue no neede of Diogenes . But put the case he were gone, wouldst thou\\nentertaine any of vs two? Vppon condition. What? That you should tell mee wherefore anye of\\nyou both were good. Why, I am a scholler, and well seene in \\nPhilosophy. And I a prentice, and well seene in paynting. Well then Granichus , be thou a painter to \\namende thine ill face, and thou Psyllus a Philosopher to\\ncorrect thine euil manners. But who is that Manes ? I care not whoe I were so I were not \\nManes . You are taken tardie. Let vs slip aside Granichus , to see the \\nsalutation betweene Manes and his maister. Manes , thou knowest the last daye I threw \\naway my dish, to drink in my hand, because it was \\nsuperfluous, now I am determined to put away my man, and\\nserue my selfe:  Quia non egeo tui vel te  . Maister, you know a while agoe I ran away,\\nso doe I meane to doe againe,  quia scio tibi non esse \\nargentum  . I know I haue no money, neither will I haue\\neuer a man: for I was resolued long sithe~ce to put away\\nboth my slaues, money and Manes . So was I determined to shake off both my\\ndogges, hunger and Diogenes O sweete concent betweene a crowde and a \\nIewes harpe. Come, let vs reconcile them It shal not neede: for this is their vse, now do\\nthey dine one vpon an other. How nowe Manes , art thou gone from thy\\nmayster. No, I didde but nowe binde my selfe to\\nhim. Why, you were at mortall iars. In faith no, we brake a bitter iest one vppon\\nanother. Why, thou art as dogged as he. My father knew them both litle whelpes. Well, I wil hie me after my maister. Why, is it supper time with Diogenes ? I, with him at al times when he hath meate. Why then euerye man to his home, and let\\nvs steale out againe anon. Where shall we meete. Why, at  Ala vendibili suspensa haedera non \\nest \\nopus  . O Psyllus ,  habeo te loco                \\nparentis  , thou\\nblessest me. Stand aside sir boy, till you bee called. \\nHephestion , how doe yee like the sweete face of Campaspe ? I cannot but commend the stout courage of\\nTimoclea . Without doubt Campaspe had som great man\\nto her father. You know Timoclea had Theagines to her \\nbrother. Timoclea stil in thy mouth, art thou not in   \\nloue? Not I. Not with Timoclea you meane, wherein you\\nresemble the Lapwing, who crieth most where her neast\\nis not. And so you lead me from espying your loue with\\nCampaspe , you cry Timoclea . Coulde I aswell subdue kingdomes, as I\\ncan my thoughtes, or were I as farre from ambition, as\\nI am from loue, all the world would account me as \\nvaliaunt in armes as I know my self moderate in affection. Is loue a vice? It is no vertue. Well, nowe shalt thou see what small \\ndifference I make betweene Alexander and Hephestion . And\\nsith thou hast beene alwaies partaker of my triumphes, \\nthou shalt be partaker of my tormentes. I loue \\nHephestion , I loue I loue Campaspe , a thing farre vnfit    \\nfor a \\nMacedonian, for a king, for Alexander . Whye hangest thou\\ndowne thy head Hephestion ? blushing to hear that which \\n\\nI am not ashamed to tell. Might my wordes craue pardon and my\\ncounsell credit, I woulde both discharge the duetie of a\\nsubiect, for so I am, and the office of a friend, for so I wil. Speake Hephestion , for whatsoeuer is spoken, \\nHephestion speaketh to Alexander . I cannot tell Alexander , whether the      \\nreporte\\nbe more shamefull to be heard, or the cause sorowfull to\\nbe beleeued? What, is the sonne of Phillip , king of \\nMacedon become the subiect of Campaspe , the captiue of \\nThebes ? Is that minde, whose greatnes the world coulde not\\ncontaine, drawn within the compasse of an idle alluring\\neie? Wil you handle the spindle with Hercules , when you\\nshuld shake the speare with Achilles ? Is the warlike sound\\nof drumme and trumpe turned to the softe noyse of lire\\nand lute, the neighing of barbed steedes, whose loudnes\\nfilled the ayre with terrour, and whose breathes \\ndimmed the sunne with smoake, conuerted to delicate tunes\\nand amorous glaunces? O Alexander , that soft and \\nyeelding minde should not bee in him, whose hard and \\nvnconquered heart hath made so many yeelde. But you\\nloue, ah griefe, but whom? Campaspe , ah shame, a maide\\nforsooth vnknowne, vnnoble, and who can tell whether\\nimmodest? whose eies are framed by arte to inamour,\\nand whose heart was made by nature to enchaunt. I, but\\nshe is bewtiful, yea, but not therefore chaste: I, but she is\\ncomly in al partes of the body: yea, but she may be \\ncrooked in some parte of the mind: I, but she is wise, yea, but\\nshe is a woman: Bewtie is like the blackberry, which \\nseemeth red, when it is not ripe, resembling pretious stones\\nthat are polished with honney, which the smother they\\nlook, the sooner they breake. It is thought wonderful \\namong the sea men, that Mugil of all fishes the swifteste is\\nfound in the belly of the Bret of all the slowest; And shal\\nit not seeme monstrous to wise men, that the hearte of\\nthe greatest conquerour of the worlde, should be found\\n\\nin the handes of the weakest creature of nature? of a \\nwoman? of a captiue? Hermyns haue faire skinnes, but\\nfowle liuers, Sepulchers fresh colours, but rotten bones,\\nwomen faire faces, but false heartes. Remember \\nAlexander thou haste a campe to gouerne, not a chamber, fall\\nnot from the armour of Mars to the armes of Venus , fro~\\nthe fiery assaults of warre, to the maidenly skirmishes of\\nloue from displaying the Eagle in thine ensigne, to sette\\ndowne the sparrow. I sigh Alexander that where fortune\\ncould not counquer, folly should ouercome. But behold\\nal the perfection that may be in Campaspe , a haire curling\\nby nature, not arte: sweete alluring eies, a faire face made\\nin despite of Venus , and a stately porte in disdaine of \\nIuno , a witte apt to conceaue, and quick to aunswere, a skin\\nas softe as silke, and as smooth as iet, a long white hand,\\na fine little foote, to conclude, all partes aunswerable to\\nthe best part, what of this? Though she haue heauenlye\\ngifts, vertue and bewtie, is she not of earthly mettal flesh\\nand bloud? You Alexander that would be a God, shewe\\nyour self in this worse then a man, so soone to bee both\\nouerseene and ouertaken in a woman, whose false teares\\nknow their true times, whose smooth wordes wounde\\ndeeper then sharpe swordes. There is no surfeit so \\ndangerous, as that of honeye, nor any poyson so deadly, as\\nthat of loue, in the one phisicke cannot preuaile, nor in\\nthe other counsel. My case were light Hephestion , and not \\nworthy to be called loue, if reason were a remedie, or \\nsente~ses could salue, that sense cannot conceaue. Litle do you\\nknow, and therefore sleightly doe you regard the dead\\nembers in a priuate perso~, or liue coles in a great prince,\\nwhose passions and thoughts do as farre exceede others\\nin extremitie, as their callinges doe in Maiestie. An \\nEclipse in the Sunne is more then the fallinge of a starre,\\nnone can conceiue the tormentes of a king, vnlesse hee\\nbe a king, whose desires are not inferiour to their \\n\\ndignities. And then iudge Hephestion if the agonies of loue be\\ndangerous in a subiect, whether they be not more then\\ndeadly vnto Alexander , whose deep and not to be \\nconceiued SOURCE TEXT HAS \"con ceiued\" DIVIDED BY LINE BREAK     \\nsighes, cleaue the heart in shiuers, whose \\nwounded thoughtes can neither be expressed nor endured.\\nCease then Hephestion with argumentes to seeke to refel\\nthat, which with their deitie the Gods cannot resist, and\\nlet this suffice to aunswere thee, that it is a king that \\nloueth and Alexander , whose affections are not to be \\nmeasured by reason, being immortall, nor I feare me to bee\\nborne being intollerable. I must needes yeeld, when neither reason nor\\ncounsel can be heard. Yeelde Hephestion , for Alexander doth    \\nloue, &\\ntherefore must obtaine. Suppose she loues not you, affection co~meth\\nnot by appointmente or birth, and then as\\ngood hated as enforced. I am a king, and wil commaund. You may, to yeelde to luste by force, but to\\nconsent to loue by feare you cannot. Why, what is that, which Alexander maye not\\nconquer as he list? Why, that which you say the Gods cannot \\nresiste, Loue. I am a conquerour, shee a captiue, I as \\nfortunate, as she faire: my greatnes may answere her wants,\\nand the giftes of my minde, the modestie of hers: Is it\\nnot likely then that shee should loue? Is it not \\nreasonable? You say that in loue there is no reason, and\\ntherefore there can be no likelyhood. No more Hephestion : in this case I wil vse   \\nmine\\nowne counsell, and in all other thine aduice, thou mayst\\nbe a good soldier, but neuer good louer. Call my page.\\nSirha, goe presentlye to Apelles , and will him to come to\\n\\nme without either delay or excuse. I goe. In the meane season to recreate my spirits, \\nbeing so neere, we will goe see Diogenes . And see\\nwhere his tub is. Diogenes . Who calleth? Alexander : how happened it that you woulde\\nnot come out of your tub to my pallace? Because it was as far from my tub to your \\npallace, as from your pallace to my tub. Why then doest thou ow no reuere~ce to kings? No. Why so? Because they be no Gods. They be Gods of the earth. Yea, Gods of earth. Plato is not of thy mind. I am glad of it. Why? Because I would haue none of Diogenes minde,\\nbut Diogenes If Alexander haue any thing that may pleasure\\nDiogenes , let me know, and take it. Then take not from me, that you cannot giue\\nme, the light of the world. What dost thou want? Nothing that you haue. I haue the world at commaund. And I in contempt. Thou shalt liue no longer then I will. But I shall die whether you wil or no. How should one learne to be content? Vnlearne to couet. Hephestion , were I not Alexander , I     \\nwould wishe\\nto be Diogenes . He is dogged, but discrete, I cannot tell how\\n\\nsharpe with a kinde of sweetenes, full of wit, yet\\ntoo to wayward. Diogenes , when I come this way again, I wil  \\nboth\\nsee thee, and confer with thee. Doe. But here commeth Apelles , how now            \\nApelles , is\\nVenus face yet finished? Not yet: Bewtie is not so soone shadowed, whose\\nperfection commeth not within the compasse\\neither of cunning or of colour. Wel let it rest vnperfect, & come you with mee,\\nwhere I will shewe you that finished by nature, \\nthat you haue beene trifling about by arte. Lady, I doubt whether there bee any colour so\\nfresh, that may shadow a countenance so faire. Sir, I had thought you had beene commaunded\\nto paint with your hand, not to glose with your tongue,\\nbut as I haue heard, it is the hardest thing in painting to\\nset down a hard fauour, which maketh you to dispair of\\nmy face, and then shal you haue as great thanks to spare\\nyour labour, as to discredit your arte. Mistresse, you neither differ from your selfe nor\\nyour sex: for knowing your own perfectio~, you seeme to\\ndispraise that which men moste commend, drawing the~\\nby that meane into an admiration, where feedinge\\nthemselues they fal into an extasie, your modestie being\\nthe cause of the one, and of the other, your affections. I am too young to vnderstande your speache,\\nthogh old enough to withsta~d your deuise: you haue bin\\nso long vsed to colours, you can do nothing but colour. Indeed the colours I see, I feare, wil altar the \\ncolour I haue: but come Madam, wil you draw neere: for\\n\\nAlexander will be here anon. Psyllus , stay you heere at the \\nwindow, if anye enquire for me, aunswere,  Non lubet esse\\ndomi  . It is alwaies my maisters fashion, when any fair\\ngentlewoman is to be drawne within, to make mee to\\nstay without. But if he shuld paint Iupiter like a Bul, like\\na Swanne, like an Eagle, then must Psyllus with one hand\\ngrinde colours, and with the other hold the candle. But\\nlet him alone, the better he shadowes her face, the more\\nwill he burne his own heart. And now if a manne coulde\\nmeete with Manes , who I dare say, lookes as leane, as if\\nDiogenes dropped out of his nose. And heere come Manes , whoe hath as muche\\nmeate in his maw, as thou hast honestie in thy \\nhead. Then I hope thou art very hungry. They that know thee, know that. But doest thou not remember that wee haue\\ncerteine licour to conferre withal. I, but I haue busines, I must go cry a thing. Why, what hast thou lost? That which I neuer had, my dinner? Foule lubber wilt thou crie for thy dinner? I meane, I must cry, not as one wold saye cry,\\nbut cry, that is, make a noyse. Why foole, that is all one, for if thou cry,    \\nthou\\nmust needes make a noise. Boy, thou art deceiued Cry hath diuerse \\nsignifications, and may bee alluded to manye thinges, knaue\\nbut one, and can be applyed but to thee. Profound Manes . Wee Cynickes are madde fellowes, didste thou\\n\\nnot finde I did quip thee? No verely, why, whats a quip? We great girders call it a short saying of a sharp\\nwitte, with a bitter sense in a sweete word. How canst thou thus diuine, deuide, define, \\ndispute, and all on the sodaine? Wit wil haue his swing, I am bewitcht, inspirde,\\ninflamed, infected. Well, then will not I tempt thy gybing spirite. Do not Psyllus , for thy dull head will bee   \\nbut a\\ngrindstone for my quick wit, which if thou whet with \\nouertwhartes,  peristi, actum est de te  . I haue drawne     \\nbloud\\nat ones braines with a bitter bob. Let me crosse my self: for I die, if I crosse   \\nthee. Let me do my busines, I my self am afraid, least\\nmy wit should waxe warm, and then must it needes \\nconsume some hard head with fine & prety iests. I am \\nsometimes in such a vaine, that for want of some dull pate to\\nworke on, I begin to gird my selfe. The Gods shield mee from such a fine fellowe,\\nwhose words melt wits like waxe. Well then, let vs to the matter. In fayth my\\nmaister meaneth to morow to flye. It is a iest. Is it a iest to flye? shouldest thou flye so      \\nsoone,\\nthou shouldest repent it in earnest. Well, I will be the cryer. O ys, o ys, o ys, All \\nmanner of men, women, or children, that wil come to \\nmorow into the market place, betweene the houres of nine\\nand ten, shall see Diogenes the Cynick fly. I do not think he wil flye. Tush, say fly. Fly. Now let vs goe: for I wil not see him againe,     \\ntill\\nmidnight, I haue a back way into his tub. Which way callest thou the backwaye, when \\neuery way is open. I meane to come in at his back. Well, let vs goe away, that we may returne \\nspeedely. I shall neuer drawe your eies well, because they\\nblind mine. Why the~, paint me without eies, for I am blind? Were you euer shadowed before of any? No. And would you could so nowe shadow me,\\nthat I might not be perceiued of any. It were pittie, but that so absolute a face should\\nfurnish Venus temple amongst these pictures. What are these pictures? This is Laeda , whom Ioue deceiued in     \\nlikenes of\\na swan. A faire woman, but a foule deceit. This is Alcmena , vnto who~ Iupiter came  \\nin shape\\nof Amphitrio~ her husband, and begate Hercules . A famous sonne, but an infamous fact. He might do it, because he was a God. Nay, therefore it was euil done, because he was \\na God. This is Danae , into whose prison             \\nIupiter drisled a\\ngolden shewre, and obtained his desire. What gold can make one yeelde to desire? This is Europa , whom Iupiter rauished,   \\nthis \\nAntiopa . Were al the Gods like this Iupiter ? There were many Gods in this like Iupiter . I thinke in those daies loue was well ratified \\n\\namong men on earth, when lust was so full \\nautorised by the Gods in heauen. Nay, you may imagine there were wome~ passing \\namiable, whe~ ther were Gods exceding amorous. Were women neuer so faire, men would be false. Were woman neuer so false, men wold be fond. What counterfeit is this Apelles ? This is Venus , the Goddesse of loue. What, be there also louing Goddesses? This is she that hath power to commaunde the\\nvery affections of the heart. How is she hired, by praier, by sacrifice, or     \\nbribs? By praier, sacrifice and bribes. What praier? Vowes irreuocable. What sacrifice? Hearts euer sighing, neuer dissembling. What bribes? Roses and kisses? but were you neuer in loue? No, nor loue in me. Then haue you iniuried many. How so? Because you haue beene loued of many. Flattered perchance of some. It is not possible that a face so faire, and a    \\nwit so\\nsharp, both without comparison, shulde not bee\\napte to loue. If you begin to tip your tong with cunninge, I\\npray dip your pensil in colours, and fall to that you must\\ndoe, not that you would doe. Parmenio I cannot tell howe it co~meth to    \\npasse,\\nthat in Alexander now a daies there groweth an vnpacie~t\\nkinde of life, in the morning he is mela~cholye, at noone\\n\\nsolomne, at all times either more sower or seuere, then\\nhe was accustomed. In kinges causes I rather loue to doubte then\\nconiecture, and thinke it better to be ignoraunt then \\ninquisitiue: they haue long eares and stretched armes, in\\nwhose heades suspition is a proofe, and to bee accused is\\nto be condemned. Yet betweene vs there canne be no daunger to\\nfinde out the cause: for that there is no malice to \\nwithstand it. It may be an vnquenchable thirste of \\nconquering maketh him vnquiet: it is not vnlikely his long ease\\nhath altred his humour: that hee shoulde be in loue, it is\\nnot impossible. In loue Clytus , no, no, it is as farre from \\nhis\\nthought, as treason in ours: hee, whose euer waking eye,\\nwhose neuer tired heart, whose body pacient of labour,\\nwhose mind vnsatiable of victorie hath alwaies bin \\nnoted, cannot so soone be melted into the weake conceites\\nof loue: Aristotle told him there were many worlds, and \\nthat he hath not conquered one that gapeth for all, \\ngalleth Alexander . But here he commeth. Parmenio , and Clitus , I would haue you  \\nboth \\nredy to goe into Persia about an ambassage no lesse \\nprofitable to me, then to your selues honourable. We are ready at all commaundes, wishing \\nnothing els, but continually to be commaunded. Well, then withdraw your selues, till I haue \\nfurther considered of this matter. Now we will see how Apelles goeth forward: I doubt\\nme that nature hath ouercom arte, and her countena~ce\\nhis cunning. You loue, and therefore think any thing. But not so farre in loue with Campaspe , as   \\nwith\\nBucephalus , if occasion serue either of conflicte or of \\nconquest. Occasion cannot want, if wil doe not. Behold\\nall Persia swelling in the pride of their owne power, the\\nScithians carelesse what courage or fortune canne doe:\\nthe Egyptians dreaminge in the southsayinges of theyr\\nAugures, and gaping ouer the smoak of their beastes \\nintralles. All these Alexander are to bee subdued, if that\\nworld be not slipped out of your head, which you haue\\nsworne to conquer with that hand. I confesse the labours fit for Alexander ,    \\nand yet\\nrecreation necessary among so manye assaultes, bloudie\\nwoundes, intollerable troubles: giue mee leaue a litle, if\\nnot to sitte, yet to breath. And doubt not but Alexander\\ncan when he wil throw affections as farre from him, as\\nhe can cowardise. But behold Diogenes talking with one \\nat his tub. One pennie Diogenes , I am a Cynick. He made thee a begger, that first gaue thee any\\nthing. Why, if thou wilte giue nothinge, no bodye\\nwil giue thee. I want nothing, till the springs dry, & the earth\\nperish. I gather for the Gods. And I care not for those gods, which want \\nmoney. Thou art a right Cynicke, that wyll gyue \\nnothing. Thou art not, that wil beg any thing. Alexander , kinge Alexander , giue a     \\npoore \\nCynick a groat. It is not for a king to giue a groat. Then giue me a talent. It is not for a begger to aske a talent. Awaye.\\nApelles ? Here. Now Gentlewomanne, doth not your bewtie\\n\\nput the painter to his trump? Yes my lord, seeing so disordered a countena~ce,\\nhe feareth he shall shadow a deformed \\ncounterfeit. Would he could colour the life with the feature.\\nAnd me thinketh Apelles , were you as cunning as report\\nfaith you are, you may paint flowers aswell with sweete\\nsmels, as fresh colours, obseruing in your mixture suche\\nthings as should draw neere to their fauours. Your maiestie must know, it is no lesse harde to\\npaint fauours then vertues, colours can neither\\nspeake nor think. Where do you first begin, when you draw anye\\npicture? The proportion of the face in iust compasse, as I\\ncan. I would begin with the eie, as a light to all the \\nrest. If you wil paint, as you are a king, your Maiesty, \\nmaye beginne wher you please, but as you wold\\nbe a painter, you must begin with the face. Aurelius would in one houre colour foure      \\nfaces. I meruaile in half an houre he did not foure. Why, is it so easie? No, but he doth it so homely. When wil you finish Campaspe ? Neuer finishe: for alwaies in absolute bewtie\\nthere is somwhat aboue arte. Why shoulde not I by labour bee as cunning as\\nApelles ? God shield you should haue cause to be so \\ncunning as Apelles . Me thinketh four colours are sufficie~t to shadow\\nany countenance, & so it was in the time of Phydias . Then had men fewer fancies, & wome~ not so many\\nfauors. For now, if the haire of her eie browes be black,\\n\\nyet must the heare of her head be yellowe: the attire of\\nher head must be different from the habite of her body,\\nels would the picture seeme like the blason of auncient\\nArmorie, not like the sweete delight of new found \\namiablenes. For as in garden knottes diuersitie of odours\\nmake a more sweete sauour, or as in musicke diuers\\nstringes cause a more delicate consent, so in painting, the\\nmore colours, the better counterfeit, obseruing blacke\\nfor a ground, and the rest for grace. Lend me thy pensil Apelles , I wil paint, and \\nthou\\nshalt iudge. Here. The coale breakes. You leane too hard. Now it blackes not. You leane too soft. This is awry. Your eie goeth not with your                      \\nSOURCE TEXT: yout hand. Now it is worse. Your hand goeth not with your minde. Nay, if all be too hard or soft, so many rules and\\nregardes, that ones hand ones eie, ones mind muste all\\ndraw together, I had rather be setting of a battell, then\\nblotting of a bourd. But how haue I done here? Like a king. I think so: but nothing more vnlike a Paynter.\\nWel Apelles , Campaspe is finished as I wish, dismisse her, &\\nbring presently her counterfeit after me. I wil. Now Hephestion , doth not this matter cotton  \\nas I\\nwould, Campaspe looketh pleasantly, liberty wil encrease\\nher bewtie, and my loue shal aduaunce her honour. I wil not contrary your maiestie, for time must\\nweare out that loue hath wroughte, and reason weane\\nwhat appetite noursed. How stately she passeth bye, yet howe soberlie, a\\n\\nsweete consent in her countenance with a chast disdain,\\ndesire mingled with coynesse, and I cannot tell howe to\\ntearme it, a curst yeelding modestie. Let her passe. So shee shall for the fairest on the earth. I shalbe hanged for tarying so long. I pray God my maister bee not flowne before \\nI come. Away Manes , my maister doth come. Where haue you bin all this while? No where but heere. Who was here sithence my comming? No body. Vngratious wag, I perceiue you haue beene a \\nloytering, was Alexander no body? He was a king, I meant no meane body. I wyll cogell your bodye for it, and then wyll I\\nsaye it was no bodye, because it was no honest\\nbody. Away in. APELLES' SOLILOQUY AND SONG PP. D2V-D3V OMITTED. This is the place, the day, the time, that        \\nDiogenes\\nhath appointed to flye. I wil not loose the flight of so fair a foule as \\nDiogenes is, though my maister cogel my no bodye,\\nas he threatned. What Psyllus , will the beaste wag his winges \\nto\\nday? We shal heare: for here commeth Manes :       \\nManes\\nwill it be? Be, he were best be as cunning as a Bee, or else\\nshortly he will not be at all. How is he furnished to flye, hath he feathers? Thou art an asse, Capons, Geese and Owles haue\\nfeathers. He hath found Dedalus old waxen wings, and\\nhath beene peecing them this moneth, he is so broad in\\nthe shoulders. O you shal see him cut the aire euen like a \\nTortoys. Methinks so wise a man should not be so mad,\\nhis body must needes be too heauy. Why, he hath eate~ nothing this seuennight but\\ncorke and feathers. Tutch him Manes . He is so light that he can scarse keepe him from\\nflying at midnight. See they beginne to flocke, and behold my \\nmaister bustels himself to flye. Yee wicked and bewitched Athenians, whose\\nbodies make the earth to groane, and whose breathes\\ninfect the aire with stench. Come ye to see Diogenes flye?\\nDiogenes commeth to see you sinke: yee call me dog, so\\nI am, for I long to gnawe the boanes in your skins. Yee\\ntearme me an hater of menne: no, I am a hater of your\\nma~ers. Your liues dissolute, not fearing death, wil proue\\nyour deaths desperate, not hoping for life. What do you\\nels in Athens but sleepe in the daye, and surfeite in the\\nnight: backGods in the morning with pride, in the \\neuening bellyGods with gluttony. You flatter kings, &\\ncall them Gods, speak trueth of your selues, and co~fesse\\nyou are deuils. From the Bee you haue take~ not the \\nhoney, but the wax to make your religion, framing it to the\\ntime, not to the trueth. Your filthy lust you colour vnder\\na courtly colour of loue, iniuries abroad vnder the title\\nof pollicies at home, & secrete malice creepeth vnder the\\nname of publike iustice. You haue caused Alexander to\\ndry vp springs and plant vines, to sow roket and weede\\nendiffe, to sheare sheepe, and shrine foxes. All conscience\\nis sealed at Athens. Swearing commeth of a hot mettle:\\nlying of a quick wit: flattery of a flowing tong, vndecent\\ntalk of a mery disposition. Al things are lawful at Athe~s.\\nEither you think there are no Gods, or I must think yee\\nare no men. You build as though you shoulde liue for \\neuer, and surfeit as though you should die to morow.\\n\\nNone teacheth true Phylosophy but Aristotle , beecause\\nhe was the kinges schoolemaister. O times, O menne, O\\ncorruption in manners. Remember that greene grasse\\nmust turne to dry hay. When you sleep, you are not sure\\nto wake, and when you rise not certeine to lye downe.\\nLooke you neuer so hye, your heads must lye leuel with\\nyour feet. Thus haue I flown ouer your disordered liues,\\nand if you will not amende your manners, I will studie\\nto flye further from you, that I may be neerer to \\nhonestie. Thou rauest Diogines , for thy life is        \\ndifferent fro~ \\nthy woordes. Did not, I see thee come out of a\\nbrothel house? was it not a shame? It was no shame to goe out, but a shame to goe\\nin. It were a good deede Manes , to beate thy \\nmaister. You were as good eate my maister. Hast thou made vs all fooles, and    \\nwilt\\nthou not flye? I tell thee, vnlesse thou be honest, I wil fly. Dog, dog, take a boane. Thy father neede fear no dogs, but dogs thy \\nfather. We wil tel Alexander , that thou reproouest  \\nhim\\nbehind his back. And I wil tell him, that you flatter him beefore\\nhis face. We wil cause all the boies in the streete to     \\nhisse\\nat thee. In deede I think the Athenians haue their \\nchildre~ redy for any vice, because they be Athenia~s. Why maister, meane you not to flye? No Manes , not without wings. Euery body wil account you a lyar. No, I warrant you: for I will alwayes say the \\nAthenians are mischieuous. I care not, it was sport ynogh for me to see    \\nthese\\nold huddles hit home. Nor I. Come, let vs goe, and hereafter when I meane \\nto raile vpon any body openly, it shall be giuen \\nout, I will flye. CAMPASPE'S SOLILOQUY OMITTED. Gentlewoman, the misfortune I had with your\\npicture, will put you to some paines, to sitte againe to be \\npainted It is small paines for me to sit still, but       \\ninfinit for\\nyou to draw still. No Madame, to painte Venus was a pleasure,\\nbut to shadowe the sweet face of Campaspe it is a\\nheauen. If your tongue were made of the same flesh that\\nyour heart is, your wordes woulde be as your thoughts \\nare: but such a common thing it is amongst you to \\ncommend, that oftentimes for fashion sake you call the~ \\nbewtifull, whom you know blacke. What might men doe to be beleeued? Whet their tongues on their hearts. So they doe, and speake as they think. I would they did. I would they did not. Why, would you haue them dissemble? Not in loue, but theyr loue. But will you giue\\nme leaue to ask you a question without offe~ce? So that you will aunswere me an other without\\nexcuse. Whom do you loue best in the world? He that made me last in the world. That was a God. I had thought it had beene a man: but whome\\ndo you honour most Apelles ? The thing that is likest you Campaspe . My picture? I dare not venture vpon your person. But come, \\nlet vs go in: for Alexander will thinke it longe till\\nwe returne. We heare nothing of our Embassage, a colour\\n\\nbelike to bleare our eies, or ticle our eares, or inflame\\nour heartes. But what doth Alexander in the meane \\nseason, but vse for Tantara, Sol. Fa. La. for his harde couch,\\ndowne beddes, for his handfull of water, his standinge\\nCup of wine? Clytus , I mislike this new delicacie and    \\npleasing\\npeace: for what els do we see now then a kind of softnes\\nin euery mans minde, Bees to make their hiues in \\nsoldiers helmets, our steedes furnished with foote clothes of\\ngolde, insteede of saddles of steele: More time to bee \\nrequired to scowre the rust of our weapons, the~ there was\\nwoont to be in subdewing the countries of our enemies.\\nSithence Alexander fell from his harde armour to his\\nsofte robes, beholde the face of his court, youthes that\\nwere woont to carry deuises of victory in their shieldes,\\nengraue now posies of loue in their ringes: they that\\nwere accustomed on trotting horses to charge the \\nenemie with a launce, now in easie coches ride vp & downe\\nto court Ladies: in steede of sworde and target to hazard\\ntheir liues, vse penne and paper to paint their loues. Yea,\\nsuch a feare and faintnes is growne in courte, that they\\nwish rather to heare the blowing of a horne to hunt, the~\\nthe sound of a trumpet to fight? O Phillip, wert thou \\naliue to see this alteration, thy men turned to women, thy\\nsoldiers to louers, gloues worne in veluet, caps in steede\\nof plumes in grauen helmets, thou wouldest either dye\\namong them for sorow, or confound them for anger. Cease Permenio , least in speaking what \\nbecommeth thee not, thou feele what liketh thee not: trueth is\\nneuer without a scratcht face, whose tongue although it\\ncannot be cut out, yet must it be tied vp. It greeueth me not a litle for Hephestion ,  \\nwhoe\\nthristeth for honour, not ease, but such is his fortune &\\nneerenesse in friendship to Alexander , that he must lay a \\npillowe vnder his head, when he would put a targette in\\nhis hand.\\n\\nBut let vs draw in, to see how well it beecomes them to\\ntread the measures in a daunce, that were wont to set\\nthe order for a march. I haue now Campaspe almost made an end. You told me Apelles , you would neuer end. Neuer end my loue: for it shalbe eternal. That is, neither to haue beginning nor ending. You are disposed to mistake, I hope you do not\\nmistrust. What will you saye, if Alexander perceiue your\\nloue? I will say, it is no treason to loue. But how if he will not suffer thee to see my \\nperson? Then will I gase continually on thy picture. That will not feede thy heart. Yet shall it fill mine eie: beesides the sweete\\nthoughtes, the sure hopes, thy protested faith, will cause\\nme to embrace thy shadow continuallye in mine armes,\\nof the which by stronge imagination I will make a \\nsubstaunce. Wel, I must be gon: but this assure your self,    \\nthat\\nI had rather be in thy shop grinding colours, then in \\nAlexanders court, following higher fortunes. CAMPASPE'S SOLILOQUY OMITTED. Now Apelles , gather thy wittes together: \\nCampaspe is no lesse wise then faire, thy selfe must be no lesse\\ncunning then faithfull. It is no small matter to be riuall\\nwith Alexander . Apelles , you must come away quicklye with the\\npicture, the king thinketh that nowe you haue\\npainted it, you play with it. If I would playe with pictures, I haue enough at\\nhome. None perhaps you like so well. It may be I haue painted none so well. I haue knowne many fairer faces. And I many better boies. I haue brought my sons Diogenes , to bee     \\ntaught\\nof thee. What can thy sonnes doe? You shall see their qualities: Daunce sirha. How like you this? doth he well? The better, the worser. The musicke very good. The Musitions very badde, who onelye studie to\\nhaue their stringes in tune, neuer framing their\\nmanners to order. Now shall you see the other: tumble sirha. How like you this? why do you laugh? To see a wagge, that was born to break his neck\\nby destinie, to practise it by arte. This dogge will bite me, I wil not be with him. Feare not boy, dogges eate no thistles. I meruaile what dog thou art, if thou be a dog. When I am hungry, a mastiue, and when my \\nbelly is full, a spaniell. Doest thou beleeue that there are any gods, that\\nthou art so dogged? I must needs beleeue there are Gods: for I think\\nthee an enemie of them. Why so? Beecause thou hast taught one of thy sonnes to\\nrule his legges, and not to follow learning, the other to\\nbend his body euery way, and his minde no way. Thou doest nothing but snarle, and barke like\\na dogge. It is the next way to driue away a theefe. Now shall you heare the third, who signes like a\\nNightingall. I care not: for I haue heard a Nightingall sing\\nher self. Sing sirha. Loe Diogenes , I am sure thou canst not doe so\\nmuch. But there is neuer a Thrush but can. What hast thou taught Manes thy man? To be as vnlike as may be thy sonnes. He hath taught me to fast, lye hard, and runne \\naway. Howe saiest thou Perim , wilte thou bee with\\nhim? I, so he will teach me first to runne away. Thou needest not be taught, thy legs are so \\nnimble. Howe sayest thou Milo , wilte thou be with \\nhim? Nay, hold your peace, he shall not. Why? There is not roome enough for him and mee \\nboth to tumble in one tub. Well Diogenes , I perceiue my sonnes brook   \\nnot\\nthy manners. I thought no lesse, when they knewe my \\nvertues. Farewel Diogenes , thou neededst not haue \\nscraped rootes, if thou woldest haue followed \\nAlexander . Nor thou haue followed Alexa~der , if thou    \\nhadst\\nscraped rootes. APELLES' SOLILOQUY OMITTED. It shal go hard, but this peace shal bring vs some\\npleasure. Downe with armes, and vp with legges, this is a \\nworld for the nonce. Sweete youthes, if you knew what it were to saue\\nyour sweete bloud, you would not so foolishly go about\\nto spend it. What delight can there be in gasshinge, to\\nmake foule scarres in faire faces, & crooked maimes in\\nstreight legges? as though men being borne goodlye by \\nnature, would of purpose become deformed by follye,\\nand all forsooth for a new found tearme, called valiant,\\na worde which breedeth more quarrelles then the sense\\ncan commendation. It is true Lays , a featherbed hath no fellow, \\ngood\\ndrinke makes good bloud, and shal pelting wordes spill\\nit? I meane to enioy the world, and to draw out my\\nlife at the wiredrawers, not to curtall it off at the \\ncuttelers. You may talke of warre, speake bigge, conquer\\nworldes with great wordes: but stay at home, where in\\nsteede of Alarums you shall haue daunces, for hot \\nbattelles with fierce menne, gentle skirmishes with faire\\nwomenne. These pewter coates canne neuer sitte so well\\nas satten dublets. Beleeue mee, you cannot conceiue\\nthe pleasure of peace, vnlesse you despise the rudenes of\\nwarre. It is so. But see Diogenes prying ouer his     \\ntubbe:\\nDiogenes , what saiest thou to such a morsel? I say, I would spit it out of my mouth, because it\\nshould not poyson my stomacke. Thou speakest as thou arte, it is no meate for\\ndogges. I am a dogge, and Phylosophy rates mee from\\ncarion. Vnciuill wretch, whose manners are \\naunswerable to thy callynge, the tyme was thou wouldest haue\\nhadde my companie, had it not beene, as thou saidst too\\ndeare. I remember there was a thing, that I repented\\n\\nme of, and now thou haste told it, indeede it was\\ntoo deare of nothing, and thou deare to no \\nbodye. Downe villaine, or I wil haue thy head broken? Will you couch? Auaunt curre: Come sweete Lays , let vs goe to\\nsome place, and possesse peace. But first let vs sing, there\\nis more pleasure in tuning of a voyce, then in a vollye of\\nshotte. Now let vs make haste, least Alexander finde\\nvs\\nhere. Mee thinketh Hephestion you are more \\nmelancholy then you were accustomed, but I perceiue it is all\\nfor Alexander . You can neither brooke this peace, nor\\nmy pleasure, be of good cheare, though I winke, I sleepe\\nnot. Melancholy I am not, nor well content: for I\\nknow not how there is such a ruste crept into my bones\\nwith this long ease, that I feare I shall not scowre it out\\nwith infinite labours. Yes, yes, if all the trauailes of conquering the\\nworld will set either thy body or mine in tune, wee will\\nvndertake them. But what think you of Apelles ? Did yee\\neuer see any so perplexed? Hee neither aunswered \\ndirectly to any question, nor looked stedfastly vppon anye\\nthing. I hold my life the painter is in loue. It may be: for commonly we see it incident in\\nartificers to be inamoured of their own workes, as \\nArchidamus of his woodden doue, Pygmalion , of his iuorie\\n\\nImage, Arachne of his wodde~ swan, especially painters,\\nwho playing with their own conceites, now coueting to\\ndraw a glauncing eie, then a rolling, now a wincking, stil\\nmending it, neuer ending it, till they bee caught with it,\\nand then poore soules they kisse the colours with their\\nlippes, with which before they were loth to tainte theyr\\nfingers. I wil finde it out. Page, goe speedelye for       \\nApelles , \\nwill him to come hether, and when you see vs earnestly\\nin talke, sodenly cry out, Apelles shoppe is on fire. It shalbe done. Forget not your lesson I meruaile what your deuice shalbe. The euent shall proue. I pittie the poore painter, if he be in loue. Pittie him not, I pray thee, that seuere grauity  \\nset\\naside, what do you think of loue? As the Macedonians doe of their hearbe Beet,\\nwhich looking yellow in the ground, and blacke in the \\nhand, thinke it better seene then toucht. But what do you imagine it to be? A word by superstition thought a God, by vse\\nturned to an humour, by self will made a flattering \\nmadnesse. You are too hard harted to think so of loue. Let\\nvs go to Diogenes . Diogenes , thou maist think it somwhat,\\nthat Alexander commeth to thee againe so soone If you come to learn, you could not come soone\\nenough, if to laugh, you be come too soone. It would better become thee to be more \\ncurteous, and frame thy self to please. And you better to be lesse, if you durst          \\ndisplease. What dost thou think of the time we haue here? That we haue litle, and lose much. If one be sick, what wouldest thou haue him do? Be sure that he make not his Phisition his hiere. If thou mightest haue thy wil, how much grou~d\\nwould content thee? As much as you in the ende must bee contented\\nwithall. What, a world? No, the length of my body. Hephestion , shal I be a litle pleasaunt with \\nhim? You may: but he wil be very peruerse with you. SOURCE TEXT: Apel.  It skilleth not, I    \\ncannot be angry with him. \\nDiogenes , I pray thee, what dost thou think of loue? A litle worser then I can of hate. And why? Because it is better to hate the thinges, which\\nmake to loue, the~ to loue the things, which giue\\noccasion of hate. Why, be not women the best creatures in the world? Next men and Bees. What dost thou dislike chiefly in a woman? One thing. What? That she is a woman. In mine opinion thou wert neuer born of a \\nwoman, that thou thinkest so hardly of wome~. But now \\nco~meth Apelles , who I am sure is as far from thy thoghts, as\\nthou art fro~ his cunning. Diogenes , I wil haue thy cabin \\nremoued nerer to my court, because I wilbe a philosopher And when you haue done so, I pray you remoue\\nyour court further from my cabinne, because I\\nwil not be a courtier. But here commeth Apelles . Apelles , what \\npeece of\\nwork haue you now in hand? None in hand, if it like your maiestie: but I am\\ndeuising a platforme in my head. I think your hand put it in your head. Is it \\nnothing about Venus ? No, but some thing about Venus . Apelles , Apelles , looke about you, your  \\nshope is\\non fire. Ay me, if the picture of Campaspe be burnt, I \\nam\\nvndone. Stay Apelles , no haste, it is your hart is   \\non fire, not\\nyour shop, & if Camp. hang there, I wold she were burnt.\\nBut haue you the picture of Campaspe ? Beelike you loue\\nher wel, that you care not thogh al be lost, so she be safe. Not loue her: but your Maiestie knowes that\\npainters in their last works are said to excell themselues,\\nand in this I haue so much pleased my self, that the \\nshadow as much delighteth mee beeing an artificer, as the\\nsubstaunce doth others that are amorous. You lay your colours grosely, though I could not\\npaint in your shop, I ca~ spy into your excuse. Be not \\nashamed Apelles , it is a Gentlemans sport to be in loue. Call\\nhither Campaspe . Me thinks I might haue bin made \\npriuie to your affection, though my counsel had not beene\\nnecessary, yet my countenance might haue bin thought\\nrequisite. But Apelles forsooth loueth vnder hand, yea &\\nvnder Alexanders nose, and, but I say no more. Apelles loueth not so: but he liueth to do as \\nAlexander will. Compaspe , here is newes, Apel. is in     \\nloue with \\nyou. It pleaseth your maiesty to say so. Hephestion , I wil try her to. Campaspe , \\nfor the good\\nqualities I know in Apelles and the vertue I see in you, I\\nam determined you shal enioy one the other. Howe saye\\nyou Campaspe , would you say, I? Your handmaid must obey, if you commaund. Think you not Hephestion that shee would faine\\nbe commaunded? I am no thought catcher, but I gesse vnhappily. I will not enforce mariage, where I cannot \\nco~pel loue. But your maiestie may moue a question, where\\n\\nyou be willing to haue a match. Beleeue me Hephestion , these parties are     \\nagreed,\\nthey would haue me both priest and witnesse. Apelles ,\\ntake Campaspe , why moue ye not? Campaspe , take Apelles ,\\nwil it not be? If you be ashamed one of the other, by my\\nconsent you shal neuer come togeather. But dissemble\\nnot Campaspe , do you loue Apelles ? Pardon my Lord, I loue Apelles . Apelles , it were a shame for you, being      \\nloued so\\nopenly of so faire a virgin, to say the contrary. Doe you\\nloue Campaspe ? Onely Campaspe . Two louing wormes, Hephestion , I perceiue \\nAlexander cannot subdue the affections of menne, though he\\nco~quer their countries. Loue falleth like dew aswel vpo~\\nthe low grasse, as vppon the high Caedar. Sparkes haue\\ntheir heate, Antes their gall, Flyes their splene. Well,\\nenioy one an other, I giue her thee fra~ckly Apelles . Thou\\nshalt see that Alexander maketh but a toye of loue, and\\nleadeth affection in fetters, vsing fa~cie as a foole to make\\nhim sport, or as a minstrell to make him merry. It is not\\nthe amorous glaunce of an eie can settle an idle thought\\nin the heart, no no, it is childrens game, a life for \\nseamesters and schollers, the one pricking in cloutes haue \\nnothing els to thinke on, the other picking fancies out of\\nbooks, haue litle els to meruaile at. Go Apelles , take with\\nyou your Campaspe , Alexander is cloied with looking on\\nthat, which thou wondredst at. Thankes to your maiestie on bended knee, you\\nhaue honoured Apelles . Thankes with bowed hearte, you haue blessed\\nCampaspe . Page, go warne Clitus and Parmenio and the \\nother Lordes to be in a readines, let the trumpet sounde,\\nstrike vp the drumme, and I will presently into Persia.\\n\\nHow now Hephestion , is Alexander able to resiste loue as\\nhe list? The conquering of Thebes was not so \\nhonourable, as the subdueing of these thoughts. It were a shame Alexander should desire to \\ncommaund the world, if he could not commaund himselfe.\\nBut come, let vs goe, I will SOURCE TEXT: wll try whether I can  \\nbetter beare\\nmy hand with my heart, then I could with mine eie. And\\ngood Hephestion , when al the world is woone, and euery\\ncountrey is thine and mine, either find me out an other\\nto subdue, or of my word I will fall in loue. Arist. Alex. Hephest. Alex.

Well, since you be so\\nimportunate, my good man shall fill the pot and get him\\nto bed, they that ply their worke must keepe\\ngood howres, one of you goe lye with him, he\\nis a cleane skind man I tell you, without either\\nspauin or windgall, so I am content to driue \\naway the time with an old wiues winters tale. No better hay in Deuonshire, a my\\nword Gammer, Ile be one of your audience. And I another thats flat. Then must I to bed with the good\\nman,  Bona nox  Gammer, God night Frolicke . Come on my Lad, thou shalt take\\nthy vnnaturall rest with me. Yet this vantage shall we haue of\\nthem in the morning, to bee ready at the sight\\nthereof extempore. Nowe this bargaine my Masters\\nmust I make with you, that you will say hum &\\nha to my tale, so shall I know you are awake. Content Gammer that will we doo. Once vppon a time there was a\\nKing or a Lord, or a Duke that had a faire\\ndaughter, the fairest that euer was; as white as snowe,\\nand as redd as bloud: and once vppon a time his\\ndaughter was stollen away, and hee sent all his\\nmen to seeke out his daughter, and hee sent so\\nlong, that he sent all his men out of his Land. Who drest his dinner then? Nay either heare my tale, or\\nkisse my taile. Well sed, on with your tale Gammer. O Lord I quite forgot, there\\nwas a Coniurer, and this Coniurer could doo\\nany thing, and hee turned himselfe into a great\\nDragon, and carried the Kinges Daughter away\\nin his mouth to a Castle that hee made of stone,\\nand there he kept hir I know not how long, till\\nat last all the Kinges men went out so long, that\\nhir two Brothers went to seeke hir. O I forget:\\nshe (he I would say) turned a proper yong man\\nto a Beare in the night, and a man in the day, and\\nkeeps by a crosse that parts three seuerall waies,\\n& he made this Lady run mad: gods me bones\\nwho comes here? Soft Gammer, here some come to tell\\n\\nyour tale for you. Let them alone, let vs heare what they\\nwill say. Vpon these chalkie Cliffs of Albion\\nWe are ariued now with tedious toile,\\nAnd compassing the wide world round about\\nTo seeke our sister, to seeke faire Delya forth,\\nYet cannot we so much as heare of hir. O fortune cruell, cruell & vnkind,\\nVnkind in that we cannot find our sister;\\nOur sister haples in hir cruell chance:\\nSoft who haue we here. Now father God be your speed,\\nWhat doo you gather there? Hips and Hawes, and stickes and\\nstrawes, and thinges that I gather on the ground\\nmy sonne. Hips and Hawes, and stickes and\\nstrawes, why is that all your foode father? Yea sonne. Father, here is an Almes pennie\\nfor mee, and if I speede in that I goe for, I will\\ngiue thee as good a Gowne of gray as euer thou\\ndiddest weare. And Father here is another almes\\npennie for me, and if I speede in my iourney, I\\nwill giue thee a Palmers staffe of yuorie, and a\\nscallop shell of beaten gold. Was shee fayre? I the fairest for white, and the\\npurest for redd, as the blood of the Deare, or the\\ndriuen snow: Then harke well and marke well, my old spell:\\nBe not afraid of euery stranger,\\nStart not aside at euery danger:\\nThings that seeme are not the same,\\nBlow a blast at euery flame:\\nFor when one flame of fire goes out, \\nThen comes your wishes well about:\\nIf any aske who told you this good,\\nSay the white Beare of Englands wood. Brother heard you not what the\\nold man said: HE REPEATS THE VERSE. Well if this doo vs any good,\\nWel fare the white Bear of Englands wood. Now sit thee here & tel a heauy tale.\\nSad in thy moode, and sober in thy cheere,\\nHere sit thee now and to thy selfe relate,\\nThe hard mishap of thy most wretched state.\\nIn Thessalie I liu'd in sweete content,\\nVntill that Fortune wrought my ouerthrow;\\n\\nFor there I wedded was vnto a dame,\\nThat liu'd in honor, vertue, loue, and fame:\\nBut Sacrapant that cursed sorcerer,\\nBeing besotted with my beauteous loue:\\nMy deerest loue, my true betrothed wife,\\nDid seeke the meanes to rid me of my life,\\nBut worse than this, he with his chanting spels,\\nDid turne me straight vnto an vgly Beare;\\nAnd when the sunne doth settle in the west,\\nThen I begin to don my vgly hide:\\nAnd all the day I sit, as now you see,\\nAnd speake in riddles all inspirde with rage,\\nSeeming an olde and miserable man:\\nAnd yet I am in April of my age. See where Venelya my betrothed loue,\\nRuns madding all inrag'd about the woods;\\nAll by his curssed and inchanting spels. But here comes Lampriscus my discontented\\nneighbour. How now neighbour, you looke\\ntowarde the ground aswell as I, you muse on\\nsomething. Neighbour on nothing, but on the\\nmatter I so often mooued to you: if you do any\\nthing for charity, helpe me; if for neighborhood\\nor brotherhood, helpe me: neuer was one so\\ncombered as is poore Lampryscus : and to\\nbegin, I pray receiue this potte of Honny to mend\\n\\nyour fare. Thankes neighbor, set it downe,\\nHonny is alwaies welcome to the Beare.\\nAnd now neighbour let me heere the cause of\\nyour comming. I am (as you knowe\\nneighbour) a man vnmaried, and liued so vnquietly\\nwith my two wiues, that I keepe euery yeare\\nholy the day wherin I buried the~ both; the first\\nwas on saint Andrewes day; the other on saint\\nLukes . And now neighbour, you of this\\ncountry say, your custome is out: but on with\\nyour tale neighbour. By my first wife, whose tongue\\nwearied me aliue, and sounded in my eares like the\\nclapper of a great Bell, whose talke was a\\ncontinuall torment to all that dwelt by her, or liued\\nnigh her, you haue heard me say I had a\\nhandsome daughter. True neighbour. Shee it is that afflictes me with her\\ncontinuall clamoures, and hangs on me like a\\nBurre: poore shee is, and proude shee is, as\\npoore as a sheepe new shorne, and as proude\\nof her hopes, as a Peacock of her taile well\\ngrowne. Well said Lampryscus , you speake\\nit like an Englishman. As curst as a waspe, and as frowarde\\nas a childe new taken from the mothers teate,\\nshee is to my age, as smoake to the eyes, or as\\nvinegar to the teeth. Holily praised neighbour, as much\\nfor the next. By my other wife I had a daughter,\\nso hard fauoured, so foule and ill faced, that I\\nthinke a groue full of golden trees; and the\\nleaues of Rubies and Dyamonds, would not\\nbee a dowrie aunswerable to her\\ndeformitie. Well neighbour, nowe you haue\\nspoke, heere me speake; send them to the Well\\nfor the water of life: there shall they finde their\\nfortunes vnlooked for; Neighbour farewell. Farewell and a thousand, and now\\ngoeth poore Lampryscus to put in execution\\nthis excellent counsell. Why this goes rounde without a\\nfidling stick; but doo you heare Gammer, was this\\nthe man that was a Beare in the night, and a\\nman in the day? I this is hee; and this man that\\ncame to him was a beggar, and dwelt vppon a\\ngreene. But soft, who comes here? O these are\\nthe haruest men; ten to one they sing a song of\\nmowing. SONG OMITTED. Gammer, what is he? O this is one that is going to the\\nconiurer, let him alone, here what he sayes. Now by Mars and Mercury, Iupiter\\nand Ianus, Sol and Saturnus, Venus and Vesta,\\nPallas and Proserpina , and by the honor of my\\nhouse Polimackeroeplacydus , it is a wonder to see\\nwhat this loue will make silly fellowes\\naduenture, euen in the wane of their wits, and infansie\\nof their discretion. Alas my friend what fortune\\ncalles thee foorth to seeke thy fortune among\\nbrasen gates, inchanted towers, fire and\\nBrimstone, thunder and lightning. Beautie I tell thee\\nis peerelesse, and she precious whom thou\\naffectest: do off these desires good countriman,\\ngood friend runne away from thy selfe, and so\\nsoone as thou canst, forget her; whom none\\nmust inherit but he that can monsters tame,\\nlabourers atchiue, riddles absolue, loose\\ninchantments, murther magicke, and kill coniuring: and\\nthat is the great and mighty Huanebango . Harke you sir, harke you; First know\\nI haue here the flurting feather, and haue giuen\\nthe Parish the start for the long stocke: Nowe\\nsir if it bee no more but running through a little\\nlightning and thunder, and riddle me riddle me\\nwhats this, Ile haue the wench from the\\nConiurer if he were ten Coniurers. I haue abandoned the Court and\\nhonourable company, to doo my deuoyre against\\nthis sore Sorcerer and mighty Magitian: if this\\nLadie be so faire as she is said to bee, she is mine,\\nshe is mine.  Meus, mea, meum, in contemptum\\nomnium Grammaticorum. O falsum Latinum  ! the faire maide is\\n minum, cum apurtinantibus gibletes  and all. If shee bee mine, as I assure my selfe\\nthe heauens will doo somewhat to reward my\\nworthines; shee shall bee allied to none of the\\nmeanest gods; but bee inuested in the most\\nfamous stocke of Huanebango\\nPolimackeroeplacidus , my Grandfather: my father\\nPergopolyneo :\\nmy mother, Dyonora de Sardynya : famouslie\\ndescended. Doo you heare sir; had not you a\\nCosen, that was called Gustecerydis ? Indeede I had a Cosen, that somtime\\nfollowed the Court infortunately, and his name\\nBustegustecerydis . O Lord I know him well: hee is the\\n\\nknight of the neates feete. O he lou'd no Capon better, he hath\\noftentimes deceiued his boy of his dinner, that\\nwas his fault good Bustegustecerydis . Come shall we goe along? Soft, here\\nis an olde man at the Crosse, let vs aske him the\\nway thither. Ho, you Gaffer, I pray you tell\\nwhere the wise man the Coniurer dwells? Where that earthly Goddesse\\nkeepeth hir abode; the commander of my thougts,\\nand faire Mistres of my heart. Faire inough, and farre inough\\nfrom thy fingering sonne. I will followe my Fortune after mine\\nowne fancie, and doo according to mine owne\\ndiscretion. Yet giue some thing to an old man\\nbefore you goe. Father mee thinkes a peece of this\\nCake might serue your turne. Yea sonne. Huanebango SOURCE TEXT: Huanabango    \\ngiueth no Cakes for\\nAlmes, aske of them that giue giftes for poore\\nBeggars.

Why faith it is a follie, for I haue no\\nmoney. Why looke you maister, doo so much for me. Alas Iack my pursse is full of money. Alas, maister, does that worde belong\\nto that accident? why me thinkes I should haue\\nseene you cast away your cloake, and in a\\nbrauado daunced a galliard round about the\\nchamber; why maister, your man can teach you more\\nwit than this, come hostis, cheere vp my maister. You are heartily welcome: and if it\\nplease you to eate of a fat Capon, a faire birde,\\na finer birde, a sweeter birde, a crisper birde, a\\nneater birde, your worship neuer eate off. Thankes my fine eloquent hostesse. But heare you maister, one worde by\\nthe way, are you content I shall be halfes in all\\nyou get in your iourney? I am Iack, here is my hand. Enough maister, I aske no more. Come Hostesse receiue your money,\\nand I thanke you for my good entertainment. You are heartily welcome sir. Come Iack whether go we now? Mary maister to the coniurers presently. Content Iack : Hostis farewell. Come my ducke come: I haue now\\n\\ngot a wife, thou art faire, art thou not? My Corebus the fairest aliue, make no\\ndoubt of that. Come wench, are we almost at the wel. I Corebus we are almost at the Well\\nnow, ile go fetch some water: sit downe while\\nI dip my pitcher in. Gently dip: but not to deepe;\\nFor feare you make the goulde~ beard to weepe. REST OF VERSE OMITTED. Oh see Corebus I haue combd a great\\ndeale of golde into my lap, and a great deale of\\ncorne. Well said wench, now we shall haue\\niust enough, God send vs coiners to coine our\\ngolde: but come shall we go home sweet heart? Nay come Corebus I will lead you. So Corebus things haue well hir,\\nThou hast gotten wealth to mend thy wit. Come away maister come. Go along Iack , ile follow thee,\\nIack , they say it is good to go crosse legged, and\\nsay his prayers backward: how saiest thou? Tut neuer feare maister, let me alone,\\nheere sit you still, speake not a word. And\\nbecause you shall not be intised with his\\ninchanting speeches; with this same wooll ile stop your\\neares: and so maister sit still, for I must to the\\nConiurer. How now, what man art thou that sits so sad\\nWhy dost thou gaze vpon these stately trees,\\nWithout the leaue and will of Sacrapant ?\\nWhat not a word but mum,\\nThen Sacrapant thou art betraide. What hand inuades the head of Sacrapa~t ?\\nWhat hatefull fury doth enuy my happy state?\\nThen Sacrapant these are thy latest dayes,\\nAlas my vaines are numd, my sinews shrinke,\\nMy bloud is pearst, my breath fleeting away,\\nAnd now in my timelesse date is come to end:\\nHe in whose life his actions hath beene so foule,\\n\\nNow in his death to hell defends his soule. Oh Sir are you gon: now I hope we\\nshall haue some other coile: Now maister how\\nlike you this; the Coniurer hee is dead, and\\nvowes neuer to trouble vs more. Now get you\\nto your faire Lady, and see what you can doo\\nwith her: Alas he heareth me not all this while;\\nbut I will helpe that. How now Iack , what news? Heere maister, take this sword and dig\\nwith it, at the foote of this hill. How now Iack , what is this? Maister, without this the Coniurer\\ncould do nothing, and so long as this light lasts,\\nso long doth his arte indure, and this being out,\\nthen doth his arte decay. Why then Iack I will soone put out\\nthis light. I maister, how? Why with a stone ile breake the glasse,\\nand then blowe it out. No maister you may as soone breake\\nthe Smiths Anfill, as this little vyoll; nor the\\nbiggest blast that euer Boreas blew, cannot blowe\\nout this little light; but she that is neither maide,\\n\\nwife, nor widowe. Maister, winde this horne;\\nand see what will happen. So maister, how like you this; this is\\nshe that ranne madding in the woods, his\\nbetrothed loue that keepes the crosse, and nowe\\nthis light being out, all are restored to their\\nformer libertie. And now maister to the Lady that\\nyou haue so long looked for. God speed faire maide sitting alone\\nthere is once.\\nGod speed faire maide; there is twise:\\nGod speed faire maide, that is thrise. Not so good sir, for you are by. Enough maister, she hath spoke, now I\\nwill leaue her with you. Thou fairest flower of these westerne parts:\\nWhose beautie so reflecteth in my sight,\\nAs doth a Christall mirror in the sonne:\\nFor thy sweet sake I haue crost the frosen Rhine ,\\nLeauing faire Po , I saild vp Danuby ,\\nAs farre as Saba whose inhansing streames,\\nCuts twixt the Tartars and the Russians ,\\n\\nThese haue I crost for thee faire Delia :\\nThen grant me that which I haue sude for long. Thou gentle knight, whose fortune is\\nso good:\\nTo finde me out, and set my brothers free,\\nMy faith, my heart, my hand, I giue to thee. Thankes gentle Madame: but heere\\ncomes Iack, thanke him, for he is the best friend\\nthat we haue. How now Iack, what hast thou there? Mary maister, the head of the coniurer. Why Iack that is impossible, he was\\na young man. Ah maister, so he deceiued them that\\nbeheld him: but hee was a miserable, old, and\\ncrooked man; though to each mans eye he\\nseemed young and fresh, for maister; this Coniurer\\ntooke the shape of the olde man that kept the\\ncrosse: and that olde man was in the likenesse of\\nthe Coniurer. But nowe maister winde your\\nhorne. Welcome Erestus , welcome faire Venelia ,\\n\\nWelcome Thelea , and Kalepha both,\\nNow haue I her that I so long haue sought,\\nSo saith faire Delia , if we haue your consent. Valiant Eumenides thou well deseruest\\nTo haue our fauours: so let vs reioyce,\\nThat by thy meanes we are at libertie.\\nHeere may we ioy each in others sight,\\nAnd this faire Lady haue her wandring knight. So maister, nowe yee thinke you haue\\ndone: but I must haue a saying to you; you\\nknow you and I were partners, I to haue halfe\\nin all you got. Why so thou shalt Iack . Why then maister draw your sworde,\\npart your Lady, let mee haue halfe of her\\npresently. Why I hope Iack thou doost but\\niest, I promist thee halfe I got, but not halfe my\\nLady. But what else maister, haue you not\\ngotten her, therefore deuide her straight, for I\\nwill haue halfe there is no remedie. Well ere I will falsifie my worde\\nvnto my friend, take her all, heere Iack ile giue\\nher thee. Nay neither more nor lesse Maister,\\nbut euen iust halfe. Before I will falsifie my faith vnto my\\n\\nfriend, I will diuide hir, Iacke thou shalt haue\\nhalfe. Bee not so cruell vnto our sister\\ngentle Knight. O spare faire Delia shee deserues\\nno death. Content your selues, my word is past\\nto him, therefore prepare thy selfe Delya for\\nthou must die. Then farewell worlde, adew\\nEumenides . Stay Master, it is sufficient I haue tride\\nyour constancie: Do you now remember since\\nyou paid for the burying of a poore fellow. I very well Iacke. Then Master thanke that good deed,\\nfor this good turne, and so God be with you all. Iacke what art thou gone?\\nThen farewell Iacke.\\nCome brothers and my beauteous Delya ,\\nErestus and thy deare Venelia :\\nWe will to Thessalie with ioyfull hearts. Agreed, we follow thee and Delya . What Gammer, a sleepe? By the Mas sonne tis almost day,\\nand my windowes shuts at the Cocks crow. Doo you heare Gammer, mee thinkes\\nthis Iacke bore a great sway amongst them. O man, this was the ghost of the\\npoore man, that they kept such a coyle to burie,\\n& that makes him to help the wandring knight\\nso much: But come let vs in, we will haue a cup\\nof ale and a tost this morning and so depart. Then you haue made an end of your\\ntale Gammer? Yes faith: When this was done I\\ntooke a peece of bread and cheese, and came\\nmy way, and so shall you haue too before you\\ngoe, to your breakefast. Enter Anticke, Frolicke and Fantasticke.

I can neuer\\ngo foorth a doores, but shee asketh mee\\nwhither I go? what I do? what busines?\\nwhat I fetch? what I carry? * As though she were a \\nConstable, or a tollgatherer. I haue pamperd her too much: she\\nhath seruants about her, wooll, flax, and all things necessary\\nto busie her withall, yet she watcheth & wondreth whither\\nI go. Well sith it is so, she shall now haue some cause, I mean\\nto dine this day abroad with a sweet friend of mine. Yea mary now comes hee to the point that prickes\\nme: this last speech gaules mee as much as it would doo his\\nwife; If he dine not at home, I am drest. We that haue Loues abroad, and wiues at home, \\nare miserably hampred, yet would euery man could tame his\\nshrewe as well as I doo mine. I haue now filcht away a fine\\nryding cloake of my wiues, which I meane to bestow vpon\\none that I loue better. Nay, if she be so warie and watchfull\\nouer me, I count it an almes deed to deceiue her. Come, what share haue I in that same? Out alas, I am taken. True, but by your friend. What, mine owne Peniculus ? Yours (ifaith) bodie and goods if I had any. Why thou hast a bodie. Yea, but neither goods nor good bodie. Thou couldst neuer come fitter in all thy life. Tush, I euer do so to my friends, I know how to    \\ncome\\nalwaies in the nicke. Where dine ye to day? Ile tell thee of a notable pranke. What did the Cooke marre your meate in the \\ndressing? Would I might see the reuersion. Tell me didst thou see a picture, how Iupiters \\nEagle \\nsnatcht away Ganimede , or how Venus stole away Adonis . Often, but what care I for shadowes, I want        \\nsubstance. Looke thee here, looke not I like such a picture? O ho, what cloake haue ye got here? Prethee say I am now a braue fellow. But hearke ye, where shall we dine? Tush, say as I bid thee man. Out of doubt ye are a fine man. What? canst adde nothing of thine owne? Ye are a most pleasant Gentleman. On yet. Nay not a word more, vnlesse ye tell mee how you \\nand your wife be fallen out. Nay I haue a greater secret then that to impart to\\nthee. Say your minde. Come farther this way from my house. So, let me heare. Nay farther yet. I warrant ye man. Nay yet farther. Tis pittie ye were not made a water-man to row in  \\na wherry. Why? Because ye go one way, and looke an other, stil    \\nleast \\nyour wife should follow ye. But what's the matter, Ist not \\nalmost dinner time? Seest thou this cloake? Not yet. Well what of it? This same I meane to giue to Erotium . That's well, but what of all this? There I meane to haue a delicious dinner prepard\\nfor her and me. And me? And thee. O sweet word. What, shall I knock presently at her \\ndoore? I knocke. But staie too Peniculus , let's not  \\nbe too\\nrash. Oh see shee is in good time comming forth. Ah, he now lookes against the Sun, how her beames \\ndazell his eyes. What mine owne Menechmus , welcome sweete\\nheart. And what am I, welcome too? You sir? ye are out of the number of my welcome\\nguests. I am like a voluntary souldier, out of paie. Erotium , I haue determined that here shal be  \\npitcht \\na field this day; we meane to drinke for the heauens: And\\nwhich of vs performes the brauest seruice at his weopon the\\nwine boll, your selfe as Captaine shall paie him his wages \\naccording to his deserts. Agreed. I would we had the weapons, for my valour pricks\\nme to the battaile. Shall I tell thee sweete mouse? I neuer looke vpon\\nthee, but I am quite out of loue with my wife. Yet yee cannot chuse, but yee must still weare\\n\\nsomething of hers: whats this same? This? such a spoyle (sweete heart) as I tooke from\\nher to put on thee. Mine owne Menechmus , well woorthie to bee my\\ndeare, of all dearest. Now she showes her selfe in her likenesse, when shee\\nfindes him in the giuing vaine, she drawes close to him. I thinke Hercules got not the garter from      \\nHypolita so hardly, as I got this from my wife. Take this, and   \\nwith\\nthe same, take my heart. Thus they must do that are right Louers: especially\\nif they meane to beggers with any speed. I bought this same of late for my wife, it stood mee\\n(I thinke) in some ten pound There's tenne pounde bestowed verie \\nthriftily. But knowe yee what I woulde haue yee \\ndoo? It shall bee done, your dinner shall be \\nreadie. Let a good dinner be made for vs three. Harke\\nye, some oysters, a mary-bone pie or two, some artichockes,\\nand potato rootes, let our other dishes be as you please. You shall sir. I haue a litle businesse in this Cittie, by that   \\ntime\\ndinner will be prepared. Farewell till then, sweete Erotium :\\nCome Peniculus . Nay I meane to follow yee: I will sooner leese my \\nlife, then fight of you till this dinner be done. Who's there? Call mee Cylindrus the Cooke\\nhither. Cylindrus , take the Hand-basket, and heere, there's\\n\\nten shillings is there not? Tis so mistresse. Buy mee of all the daintiest meates ye can get, ye\\nknow what I meane: so as three may dine passing well, and\\nyet no more then inough. What guests haue ye to day mistresse? Here will be Menechmus and his Parasite, and my\\nselfe. That's ten persons in all. How many? Ten, for I warrant you, that Parasite may stand for\\neight at his vittels. Go dispatch as I bid you, and looke ye returne with\\nall speed. I will haue all readie with a trice. Surely Messenio , I thinke Sea-fairers neuer   \\ntake\\nso comfortable a ioy in any thing, as when they haue\\nbene long tost and turmoylde in the wide seas, they hap at\\nlast to ken land. Ile be sworn, I shuld not be gladder to see a whole\\nCountry of mine owne, then I haue bene at such a sight. But\\nI pray, wherfore are we now come to Epidamnum ? must we\\nneeds go to see euerie Towne that we heare off? Till I finde my brother, all Townes are alike to\\nme: I must trie in all places. Why then let's euen as long as wee liue seeke your\\nbrother: six yeares now haue we roamde about thus, Istria,\\nHispania, Massylia, Ilyria , all the vpper sea, all high           \\nGreece ,\\nall Hauen Towns in Italy , I think if we had sought a needle\\nall this time, we must needs haue found it, had it bene aboue\\nground. It cannot be that he is aliue, and to seek a dead man\\n\\nthus among the liuing: what folly is it? Yea, could I but once find any man that could\\ncertainly enforme me of his death, I were satisfied; otherwise\\nI can neuer desist seeking: Litle knowest thou Messenio how\\nneare my heart it goes. This is washing of a Blackamore. Faith let's goe\\nhome, vnlesse ye meane we should write a storie of our\\ntrauaile. Sirra, no more of these sawcie speeches, I         \\nperceiue I\\nmuch teach ye how to serue me, not to rule me. I, so, now it appeares what it is to be a         \\nseruant. Wel\\nyet I must speake my conscience. Do ye heare sir? Faith I\\nmust tell ye one thing, when I looke into the leane estate of\\nyour purse, and consider aduisedly of your decaying stocke,\\nI hold it verie needfull to be drawing homeward, lest in\\nlooking your brother, we quite lose our selues. For this assure\\nyour selfe, this Towne Epidamnum , is a place of outragious\\nexpences, exceeding in all ryot and lasciuiousnesse: and (I\\nheare) as full of Ribaulds, Parasites, Drunkards, Catchpoles,\\nCony-catchers, and Sycophants, as it can hold: then for\\nCurtizans, why here's the currantest stamp of them in the world.\\nYe must not thinke here to scape with as light cost as in\\nother places. The verie name shews the nature, no man comes \\nhither  sine damno  . Yee say very well indeed: giue mee my purse into\\nmine owne keeping, because I will so be the safer,  sine         \\ndamno  . Why sir? Because I feare you wil be busie among the \\nSOURCE TEXT: among the the \\nCurtizans, & so be cosened of it: then should I take great paines\\nin belabouring your shoulders, so to auoid both these harms,\\nIle keep it my selfe. I pray do so sir, all the better. * I haue tickling geare here yfaith for their dinners: It \\ngrieues me to the heart to think how that cormorant knaue\\nPeniculus must haue his share in these daintie morsels But\\n\\nwhat? Is Menechmus come alreadie, before I could come\\nfrom the Market? Menechmus how do ye sir? how haps it\\nye come so soone? God a mercy my good friend, doest thou know\\nmee? Know ye? no not I. Where's mouldichappes that \\nmust dine with ye? A murrin on his manners. Whom meanest thou good fellow? Why Peniculus worship, that whorson            \\nlick-trencher,\\nyour Parasiticall attendant. What Peniculus ? what attendant? My Attendant?\\nSurely this fellow is mad. Did not I tell ye what cony-catching villaines yee\\nshould finde here? Menechmus , harke ye sir, ye come too soone    \\nbacke\\nagain to dinner, I am but returned from the Market. Fellow, here thou shalt haue money of me, goe get\\nthe priest to sacrifice for thee. I know thou art mad, els thou\\nwouldst neuer vse a straunger thus? Alas sir, Cylindrus was wont to be no stranger \\nto you,\\nknow ye not Cylindrus ? Cylindrus , or Coliendrus , or what the    \\ndiuell thou art,\\nI know not, neither do I care to know. I know you to be Menechmus . Thou shouldst be in thy wits, in that thou namest\\nme so right, but tell me, where hast thou knowne me? Where? euen heere, where ye first fell in loue with\\nmy mistresse Erotium . I neither haue Louer, neither knowe I who thou\\nart. Know ye not who I am? who fils your cup &\\ndresses your meate at our house? What a slaue is this? that I had somewhat to breake\\nthe Rascals pate withall. At your house, when as I neuer came in Epidamnum\\ntill this day. Oh thats true. Do ye not dwell in yonder house? Foule shame light vpon them that dwell there, for\\nmy part. Questionlesse, hee is mad indeede, to curse himselfe\\nthus. Harke ye Menechmus . What saist thou? If I may aduise ye, ye shall bestow this money which\\nye offred me, vpon a sacrifice for your selfe: for out of doubt\\nyou are mad that curse your selfe. What a verlet art thou to trouble vs thus? Tush he wil many times iest with me thus. Yet when\\nhis wife is not by, tis a ridiculous iest. VVhat's that? This I say, Thinke ye I haue brought meate inough\\nfor three of you? If not, ile fetche more for you and your\\nwench, and snatchcrust your Parasite. VVhat wenches? what Parasites? Villaine, Ile make thee tell me what thou meanest\\nby all this talke? Away Iack Napes, I say nothing to thee, for I know\\nthee not, I speake to him that I know. Out drunken foole, without doubt thou art out of\\nthy wits. That you shall see by the dressing of your meat. Go,\\ngo, ye were better to go in and finde somewhat to do there,\\nwhiles your dinner is making readie. Ile tell my mistresse ye\\nbe here. Is he gone? Messenio I think vppon thy words\\nalreadie. Tush marke I pray, Ile laie fortie pound here dwels\\nsome Curtizan to whom this fellow belong. But I wonder how he knowes my name. Oh ile tell yee. These Courtizans assoone as anie\\nstraunge shippe arriueth at the Hauen, they sende a boye\\nor a wench to enquire what they be, what their names be,\\nwhence they come, wherefore they come, &c. If they can by\\n\\nany meanes strike acquaintance with him, or allure him to\\ntheir houses, he is their owne. We are here in a tickle place\\nmaister, tis best to be circumspect. I mislike not thy counsaile Messenio . I, but follow it then. Soft, here comes somebodie\\nforth. Here sirs, Marriners, keep this same amongst you. Let the doore stand so, away, it shall not be shut. Make\\nhast within there ho: maydes looke that all things be readie.\\nCouer the boord, put fire vnder the perfuming pannes, let all\\nthings be very handsome. Where is hee, that Cylindrus sayd\\nstood without here? Oh, what meane you sweet heart, that\\nye come not in? I trust you thinke your selfe more welcome\\nto this house then to your owne, and great reason why you\\nshould do so. Your dinner & all things are readie as you\\nwilled. Will ye go sit downe? Whom doth this woman speake to? Euen to you sir, to whom else should I speake? Gentlewoman ye are a straunger to me, and I\\nmaruell at your speeches. Yea sir, but such a straunger, as I acknowledge ye \\nfor\\nmy best and dearest friend, and well you haue deserued it. Surely Messenio , this woman is also mad or    \\ndrunke,\\nthat vseth all this kindnesse to mee vppon so small\\nacquaintance. Tush, did not I tell ye right? these be but leaues\\nwhich fall vpon you now, in comparison of the trees that wil\\ntumble on your necke shortly. I tolde ye, here were siluer\\ntong'de hacsters. But let me talke with her a litle. \\nGentlewoman what acquaintance haue you with this man? where\\nhaue you seene him? Where he sawe me, here in Epidamnum . In Epidamnum ? who neuer till this day set    \\nhis foote\\nwithin the Towne. Go, go, flowting Iack. Menechmus what need al  \\nthis?\\nI pray go in. She also calls me by my name. She smels your purse. Messenio come hither, here take my purse. Ile  \\nknow\\nwhether she aime at me or my purse, ere I go. Will ye go in, to dinner sir? A good motion, yea and thanks with all my heart. Neuer thanke me for that which you commaunded\\nto be prouided for your selfe. That I commaunded? Yea, for you and your Parasite. My Parasite? Peniculus , who came with you this morning when\\nyou brought me the cloake which you got from your wife. A cloake that I brought you, which I got from my\\nwife? Tush what needeth all this iesting? Pray leaue off. Iest or earnest, this I tell ye for a truth. I     \\nneuer had\\nwife, neither haue I, nor neuer was in this place till this\\ninstant: for only thus farre am I come, since I brake my fast in\\nthe ship. What ship do ye tell me off? Marry ile tell ye, an old rotten weather-beaten\\nship, that we haue saild vp and downe in this sixe yeares, Ist\\nnot time to be going homewards thinke ye? Come, come, Menechmus , I pray leaue this     \\nsporting\\nand go in. Well Gentlewoman, the truth is, you mistake my\\nperson, it is some other that you looke for. Why, thinke ye I know ye not to be Menechmus ,\\nthe sonne of Moschus , and haue heard ye say, ye were borne\\nat Syracusis , where Agathocles did raigne, then             \\nPythia , then\\nLiparo , and now Hiero . All this is true. Either shee is a witch, or else shee hath dwelt   \\nthere\\nand knew ye there. Ile goe in with her Messenio , Ile see further \\nof this matter. Ye are cast away then. Why so? I warrant thee. I can loose nothing,\\nsomwhat I shall gaine, perhaps a good lodging during my abode\\nheere. Ile dissemble with her an other while. Nowe when\\nyou please let vs go in, I made straunge with you, because\\nof this fellow here, least he should tell my wife of the cloake\\nwhich I gaue you. Will ye staie any longer for your Peniculus your\\nParasite? Not I, Ile neither staie for him, nor haue him let\\ncome in, if he do come. All the better. But sir, will yee doo one thing for\\nme. What is that? To beare that cloake which you gaue me, to the\\nDiars, to haue it new trimd and altred. Yea that will be well, so my wife shall not know it.\\nLet mee haue it with mee after dinner. I will but speake a \\nword or two with this fellowe, then ile follow yee in. Ho\\nMessenio come aside: goe and prouide for thy selfe, and these\\nshipboyes in some Inne, then looke that after dinner you\\ncome hither for me. Ah maister will yee be conycatcht thus \\nwilfully. Peace foolish knaue, seest thou not what a sot she\\nis, I shall coozen her I warrant thee. Ay maister. Wilt thou be gone? See, see, she hath him safe inough now. Thus\\nhe hath escaped a hundreth Pyrates hands at sea: and now\\none land-rouer hath bourded him at first encounter. Come\\naway fellowes. * Twentie yeares I thinke and more, haue I playde\\nthe knaue, yet neuer playd I the foolish knaue as I\\nhaue done this morning. I follow Menechmus , and he goes\\nto the Hall where now the Sessions are holden: there\\nthrusting our selues into the prease of people, when I was in\\nmidst of all the throng, he gaue me the slip, that I could\\nneuer more set eye on him, and I dare sweare, came directly\\nto dinner. That I would he that first deuised these Sessions\\nwere hang'd, and all that euer came of him: tis such a\\nhinderance to men that haue belly businesses in hand. If a man be\\nnot there at his call, they amearce him with a vengeance.\\nMen that haue nothing else to do, that do neither bid anie\\nman, nor are themselues bidden to dinner, such should come\\nto Sessions, not we that haue these matters to looke too. If it\\nwere so, I had not thus lost my dinner this day: which I think\\nin my conscience he did euen purposely couzen me off. Yet\\nI meane to go see: if I can but light vppon the reuersion, I\\nmay perhaps get my peny-worthes. But how now? is this\\nMenechmus comming away from thence? dinner done, and\\nall dispacht? what execrable lucke haue I? Tush I warrant ye, it shall be done as ye would wish, Ile\\nhaue it so altered and trimd anew, that it shall by no meanes\\nbe knowne againe. He carries the cloake to the Dyars, dinner done, the\\nwine drunke vp, the Parasite shut out of doores. Well, let me\\nliue no longer, but ile reuenge this iniurious mockerie. But\\nfirst ile harken awhile what he saith. Good goddes, who euer had such lucke as I? Such\\ncheare, such a dinner, such kinde entertainment? And for a\\nfarewell, this cloake which I meane shall go with me. He speakes so softly, I cannot heare what hee saith,\\nI am sure he is now flowting at me for the losse of my \\ndinner. She tels me how I gaue it her, and stole it from my\\nwife. When I perceiued she was in an error, though I knew\\nnot how, I began to sooth her, and to say euery thing as she\\nsaid. Meane while I far'd well, and that a free cost. Well, I'le go talke with him. Who is this same that comes to me? O well met fickle-braine, false and treacherous\\ndealer, craftie and vniust promise breaker. How haue I deserued,\\nyou should so giue me the slip, come before and dispatch the\\ndinner, deale so badly with him that hath reuerenst ye like a \\nsonne. Good fellow what meanest thou by these speeches?\\nRaile not on mee, vnlesse thou intendst to receiue a Railers\\nhire. I haue receiued the iniury (sure I am) alreadie. Prethee tell me, what is thy name? Well, well, mock on sir, mock on, doo ye not know\\nmy name? In troth I neuer sawe thee in all my life, much    \\nlesse\\ndo I know thee. Fie, Awake Menechmus awake, ye ouersleepe your\\nselfe. I am awake, I know what I say. Know you not Peniculus ? Peniculus , or Pediculus , I know thee not. Did ye filch a cloake from your wife this morning,\\nand bring it hither to Erotium ? Neither haue I wife, neither gaue I any cloake to\\nErotium , neither filcht I any from any bodie. Will ye denie that which you did in my company? SOURCE TEXT: Pen.  Wilt thou say I haue    \\ndone this in thy company? VVill I say it? yea I will stand to it. Away filthie mad driuell away, I will talke no\\n\\nlonger with thee. Not a world of men shall staie me, but ile go tell \\nhis\\nwife of all the whole matter, sith he is at this point with me.\\nI will make this same as vnblest a dinner as euer he eate. It makes mee wonder, to see how euery one that\\nmeetes me cauils thus with me. VVherefore comes foorth\\nthe mayd now? Menechmus , my mistresse commends her hartily to you,\\nand seeing you goe that way to the Dyars, shee also desireth\\nyou to take this Chaine with you, and put it to mending at\\nthe Goldsmythes, shee would haue two or three ounces of\\ngold more in it, and the fashion amended. Either this or any thing else within my power, tell\\nher, I am readie to accomplish. Do ye know this Chaine sir? Yea I know it to be gold. This is the same you once tooke out of your wiues\\nCasket. VVho, did I? Haue you forgotten? I neuer did it. Giue it me againe then. Tarry, yes I remember it: tis it I gaue your       \\nmistres. Oh, are ye aduised? VVhere are the bracelets that I gaue her likewise? I neuer knew of anie. Faith, when I gaue this, I gaue them too. VVell sir, ile tell her this shall be done? I, I, tell her so, shee shall haue the cloake and  \\nthis\\nboth togither. I pray Menechmus , put a litle iewell for my   \\neare to\\nmaking for me, ye know I am alwaies readie to pleasure you. I will, giue mee the golde, ile paie for the\\nworkemanship. Laie out for me, ile paie it ye againe. Alas I haue none now. When you haue, will ye? I will. Goe bid your mistresse make no doubt of\\nthese, I warrant her, ile make the best hand I can of them. Is\\nshe gone? Doo not all the gods conspire to loade mee with\\ngood lucke? well I see tis high time to get mee out of these\\ncoasts, least all these matters should be lewd deuises to draw\\nme into some snare. There shall my garland lie, because if\\nthey seeke me, they may thinke I am gone that way. * I wil\\nnow goe see if I can finde my man Messenio , that I may  \\ntell\\nhim how I haue sped. Thinkes he I will be made such a sot, and   \\nto be\\nstill his drudge, while he prowles and purloynes all that\\nI haue to giue his Trulles? Nay hold your peace, wee'll catch him in the nicke.\\nThis way he came, in his garland forsooth, bearing the cloak\\nto the Dyars. And see I pray where the garland lyes, this\\nway he is gone. See, see, where he comes againe now\\nwithout the cloake. VVhat shall I now do? VVhat? that which ye euer do, bayt him for life. Surely I thinke it best so. Stay, wee will stand a side a little, ye shall     \\ncatch him\\nvnawares. It would make a man at his wittes end, to see how\\nbrabbling causes are handled yonder at the Court. If a\\npoore man neuer so honest, haue a matter come to be scand,\\nthere is hee outfaste, and ouerlaide with countenance: If a \\n\\nrich man neuer so vile a wretch come to speake, there they\\nare all readie to fauour his cause. VVhat with facing out bad\\ncauses for the oppressors, and patronizing some iust actions\\nfor the wronged, the Lawyers they pocket vp all the gaines.\\nFor mine own part, I come not away emptie, though I haue\\nbene kept long against my will: For taking in hand to \\ndispatch a matter this morning for one of my acquaintaunce,\\nI was no sooner entered into it, but his aduersaries laide so\\nhard vnto his charge, and brought such matter against him,\\nthat do what I could, I could not winde my selfe out til now.\\nI am sore afrayd Erotium thinks much vnkindnes in me that\\nI staid do long, yet she will not be angry considering the gift\\nI gaue her to day. How thinke ye by that? I thinke him a most vile wretch thus to abuse  \\nme. I will hie me thither. Yea go pilferer SOURCE TEXT: pilferet , goe    \\nwith shame inough, no bodie\\nsees your lewd dealings and vile theeuery. How now wife, what aile yee? what is the\\nmatter? Aske yee mee whats the matter? Fye vppon\\nthee. Are ye not in a fit of an ague, your pulses beate so\\nsore? to him I say. Pray wife, why are ye so angry with me? Oh you know not? He knowes, but he would dissemble it. What is it? My cloake. Your cloake. My cloake man, why do ye blush? He cannot cloake his blushing. Nay I might not go\\nto dinner with you, do ye remember? to him I say. Hold thy peace Peniculus . Ha hold my peace, looke ye, he beckons on mee to\\nhold my peace. I neither becken nor winke on him. Out, out, what a wretched life is this that I liue. Why what aile ye woman? Are ye not ashamed to deny so confidently, that\\nwhich is apparant. I protest vnto you before all the goddes (is not   \\nthis\\ninough) that I beckond not on him. Oh sir, this is an other matter, touch him in the\\nformer cause. What former cause? The cloake man, the cloake, fetch the cloake againe\\nfrom the Dyars. What cloake? Nay ile say no more, sith ye know nothing of your\\nowne doings. Tell me wife, hath any of your seruants abused you?\\nLet me know. Tush, tush. I would not haue you to be thus disquietted. Tush, tush. You are fallen out with some of your friends       \\nSOURCE TEXT: ftiends . Tush, tush. Sure I am, I haue not offended you. No, you haue dealt verie honestly. Indeed wife, I haue deserued none of these words,\\ntell me, are ye not well? What shall he flatter ye now? I speak not to thee knaue. Good wife come hither. Away, away, keep your hands off. So, bid me to dinner with you againe, then slip away\\nfrom me, when you haue done, come forth brauely in your\\ngarland to flout me: Alas you knew not me, euen now. Why Asse, I neither haue yet dined, nor came I\\nthere, since we were there togither. VVho euer heard one so impudent? Did yee not\\nmeete me here euen now, and would make me beleeue I was\\n\\nmad, and said ye were a straunger, and ye knew me not? Of a truth since wee went togither to the Sessions\\nHall, I neuer returned till this very instant, as you two met\\nme. Go too, go too, I know ye well inough. Did ye think\\nI would not cry quittance with you, yes faith, I haue tolde\\nyour wife all. What hast thou told her? I cannot tell, aske her. Tell me wife, what hath he told ye of me? Tell me\\nI say, what was it? As though you knew not, my cloake is stolne from me. Is your cloake stolne from ye? Do ye aske me? If I knew, I would not aske. O craftie companion, how he would shift the\\nmatter, Come, come, deny it not, I tell ye, I haue bewrayd all. What hast thou bewrayd? Seeing ye will yeeld to nothing be it neuer so\\nmanifest, Heare mee, and ye shall know in fewe words both the\\ncause of my griefe, and what he hath told me. I say my cloake\\nis stolne from me. My cloake is stolne from me? Looke how he cauils, she saith it is stolne from\\nher. I haue nothing to say to thee: I say wife tell me. I tell ye, my cloake is stolne out of my house. Who stole it? He knowes best that carried it away. Who was that? Menechmus. T'was very ill done of him. What Menechmus was\\nthat? You. I, who will say so? I will. And I: and that you gaue it to Erotium . I gaue it? You. You, you, you, shall we fetch a kennell of Beagles\\nthat may cry nothing but you, you, you, you. For we are\\nwearie of it. Heare me one word wife, I protest vnto you by all\\nthe gods, I gaue it her not, indeed I lent it her to vse a while. Faith sir, I neuer giue nor lend your apparell \\nout of\\ndoores, mee thinkes ye might let mee dispose of mine owne\\ngarments, as you do of yours. I pray then fetch it mee home\\nagaine. You shall haue it againe without faile. Tis best for you that I haue: otherwise thinke \\nnot\\nto roost within these doores againe. Harke ye, what say ye to me now, for bringing these\\nmatters to your knowledge? I say, when thou hast anie thing stolne from   \\nthee,\\ncome to me, and I will helpe thee to seeke it. And so\\nfarewell. God a mercy for nothing, that can neuer be, for    \\nI\\nhaue nothing in the world worth the stealing. So now with\\nhusband and wife and all, I am cleane out of fauour. A\\nmischiefe on ye all. My wife thinks she is notably reueng'd on me, now\\nshe shuttes mee out of doores, as though I had not a better\\nplace to be welcome too. If she shut me out, I know who wil\\nshut me in. Now will I entreate Erotium to let me haue the\\ncloake againe to stop my wiues mouth withal, and then will\\nI prouide a better for her. Ho who is within there?\\nsomebodie tell Erotium I must speake with her. Who calls? Your friend, more then his owne. O Menechmus , why stand ye here? pray come in \\nSOURCE TEXT: it . Tarry, I must speake with ye here. Say your minde. Wot ye what? my wife knowes all the matter now,\\nand my comming is, to request you, that I may haue againe\\nthe cloake which I brought you, that so I may appease her:\\nand I promise you, ile giue ye an other worth two of it. Why I gaue it you to carry to your Dyars, and \\nmy\\nchaine likewise, to haue it altered. Gaue mee the cloake and your chaine? In truth I\\nneuer sawe ye since I left it heere with you, and so went\\nto the Sessions, from whence I am but now returned. Ah then sir, I see you wrought a deuice to defraude\\nmee of them both, did I therefore put yee in trust? Well,\\nwell. To defraud ye? No, but I say, my wife hath\\nintelligence of the matter. Why sir, I asked them not, ye brought them me \\nof\\nyour owne free motion. Now ye require them againe, take\\nthem, make sops of them: you and your wife togither, think\\nye I esteeme them or you either. Goe, come to mee againe\\nwhen I send for you. What so angry with mee, sweete Erotium ?       \\nStaie, I\\npray staie. Staie? Faith sir no: thinke ye I will staie at  \\nyour\\nrequest? What gone in chasing, and clapt to the doores: now\\nI am euerie way shut out for a very benchwhistler: neither\\nshall I haue entertainment heere nor at home. I were best\\ngo trie some other friends, and aske counsaile what to do. Most foolishly was I ouerseene in giuing my purse and\\nmoney to Messenio , whom I can no where find, I feare\\nhe is fallen into some lewd companie. I maruaile that my husband comes not yet, but see\\nwhere he is now, and brings my cloake with him. I muse where the knaue should be. I will go ring a peale through both his eares for  \\nthis\\nhis dishonest behauiour. Oh sir, ye are welcome home with\\nyour theeuery on your shoulders, are ye not ashamde to let\\nall the world see and speake of your lewdnesse? How now? what lackes this woman? Impudent beast, stand ye to question about it? For\\nshame hold thy peace. What offence haue I done woman, that I should\\nnot speake to you? Askest thou what offence? O shamelesse\\nboldnesse. Good woman, did ye neuer heare why the\\nGrecians termed Hocuba to be a bitch? Neuer. Because she did as you do now, on whom soeuer she\\nmet withall, she railed, and therfore well deserued that\\ndogged name. These foule abuses and contumelies, I can neuer \\nendure, nay rather will I liue a widowes life to my dying day. What care I whether thou liuest as a widow or as a\\nwife. This passeth, that I meet with none but thus they vexe\\nme with straunge speeches. What straunge speeches? I say I will surely liue a \\nwidowes life, rather then suffer thy vile dealings. Prethee for my part, liue a widow till the worldes\\nend, if thou wilt. Euen now thou deniedst that thou stolest it from\\n\\nme, and now thou bringest it home openly in my sight. Art\\nnot ashamde? Woman, you are greatly to blame to charge mee\\nwith stealing of this cloake, which this day an other gaue me\\nto carry to be trimde. Well, I will first complaine to my father. Ho boy,\\nwho is within there? Vecio go runne quickly to my father,\\ndesire him of all loue to come ouer quickly to my house. Ile\\ntell him first of your prankes, I hope he will not see me thus\\nhandled. What a Gods name meaneth this mad woman thus\\nto vexe me? I am mad because I tell ye of your vile actions, and\\nlewde pilfring away my apparell and my Iewels, to carry to\\nyour filthie drabbes. For whome this woman taketh mee I knowe not, I\\nknow her as much as I know Hercules wiues father. Do ye not know me? That's well, I hope ye know\\nmy father, here he comes, looke, do ye know him? As much as I knew Calcas of Troy . Euen    \\nhim and\\nthee I know both alike. Doest know neither of vs both, me nor my father? Faith nor thy grandfather neither. This is like the rest of your behauiour. * Though bearing so great a burthen, as olde age, I can\\nmake no great haste, yet as I can, I will goe to my daughter,\\nwho I know hath some earnest businesse with me, that shee\\nsends in such haste, not telling the cause why I should come.\\nBut I durst laie a wager, I can gesse neare the matter: I\\nsuppose it is some brabble between her husband and her. These\\nyoong women that bring great dowries to their husbands,\\nare so masterfull and obstinate, that they will haue their own\\nwils in euerie thing, and make men seruants to their weake\\naffections. And yoong men too, I must needs say, be naught\\nnow a dayes. Well ile go see, but yonder mee thinks stands\\n\\nmy daughter, and her husband too. Oh tis euen as I gessed. Father ye are welcome. How now daughter? What? is all well? why is your\\nhusband so sad? haue ye bin chiding? tell me, vvhich of you\\nis in the fault? First father know, that I haue not any way\\nmisbehaued my selfe, but the truth is, I can by no meanes endure\\nthis bad man to die for it: and therefore desire you to take\\nme home to you againe. What is the matter. He makes me a stale and a laughing stocke to all the\\nworld. Who doth? This good husband here, to whom you married me. See, see, how oft haue I warned you of falling out\\nwith your husband? I cannot auoid it, if he doth so fowly abuse me. I alwaies told ye, you must beare with him, ye must\\nlet him alone, ye must not watch him, nor dog him, nor\\nmeddle with his courses in any sort. Hee hauntes naughtie harlottes vnder my\\nnose. Hee is the wiser, because hee cannot bee quiet at\\nhome. There hee feastes and bancquets, and spendes\\nand spoiles. Wold ye haue your husband serue ye as your drudge?\\nYe will not let him make merry, nor entertaine his friendes\\nat home. Father will ye take his part in these abuses, and\\nforsake me? Not so daughter, but if I see cause, I wil as well \\ntel him\\nof his dutie. I vvould I vvere gone from this prating father and\\ndaughter. Hitherto I see not but hee keepes ye vvell, ye vvant\\n\\nnothing, apparrell, mony, seruants, meate, drinke, all thinges\\nnecessarie: I feare there is fault in you. But he filcheth away my apparrell and my iewels, to\\ngiue to his Trulles. If he doth so, tis verie ill done, if not, you doo \\nill to\\nsay so. You may beleeue me father, for there you may see\\nmy cloake which now he hath fetcht home againe, and my\\nchaine which he stole from me. Now will I goe talke with him to knowe the     \\ntruth.\\nTell me Menechmus , how is it, that I heare such disorder in \\nyour life? Why are ye so sad man? wherein hath your wife\\noffended you? Old man (what to call ye I know not) by high   \\nIobe ,\\nand by all the Gods I sweare vnto you, whatsoeuer this\\nwoman here accuseth mee to haue stolne from her, it is vtterly\\nfalse and vntrue, and if I euer set foote within her doores, I\\nwishe the greatest miserie in the worlde to light vppon\\nme. Why fond man, art thou mad to deny that thou euer\\nsetst foote within thine owne house where thou dwellest? Do I dwell in that house? Doest thou denie it? I do. Harke yee daughter, are ye remooued out of your\\nhouse? Father, he vseth you as he doth me, this life I haue\\nwith him. Menechmus , I pray leaue this fondnesse, ye    \\niest too\\nperuersly with your friends. Good old father, what I pray haue you to do with\\nme? or why should this woman thus trouble me, with whom\\nI haue no dealings in the world? Father, marke I pray how his eies sparkle, they    \\nrowle\\nin his head, his colour goes and comes, he lookes wildly.\\nSee, see. What? they say now I am mad, the best way for me\\nis to faine my selfe mad indeed, so I shall be rid of them. Looke how he stares about, now he gapes. Come away daughter, come from him. Bachus, Appollo, Phoebus , do ye call mee to \\ncome\\nhunt in the woods with you, I see, I heare, I come, I flie, but\\nI cannot get out of these fields. Here is an old mastiffe bitch\\nstands barking at mee, and by her standes an old goate that\\nbeares false witnesse against many a poore man. Out vpon him Bedlam foole. Harke, Appollo commaunds me that I should  \\nrende \\nout hir eyes with a burning lampe. O father, he threatens to pull out mine eyes. Good gods, these folke say I am mad, and\\ndoubtlesse they are mad themselues. Daughter. Here father, what shall we do? What if I fetch my folkes hither, and haue him\\ncarried in before he do any harme. How now? they will carry mee in if I looke not to\\nmy selfe: I were best to skare them better yet. Doest thou\\nbid me Phoebus , to teare this dog in peeces with my nayles?\\nif I laie hold on him, I will do thy commandment. Get thee into thy house daughter, away quickly. She is gone: yea Appollo I will sacrifice this \\nolde\\nbeast vnto thee: and if thou commandest mee, I will cut his\\nthroate with that dagger that hangs at his girdle. Come not neare me sirra. Yea I will quarter him, and pull all the bones out\\nof his flesh, then will I barrell vp his bowels. Sure I am sore afraid he will do some hurt. Many things thou commandest me Appollo , wouldst\\nthou haue me harnesse vp these wilde horses, and then clime\\nvp into the Chariot, & so ouer-ride this old stincking\\ntoothlesse Lyon. So now I am in the Chariot, and I haue hold on\\nthe raines, here is my whip, hait, come ye wilde Iades, make a \\n\\nhideous noyse with your stamping: hait I say, will ye not\\ngo? What? doth he threaten me with his horses? Harke, now Appollo bids mee ride ouer him that\\nSOURCE TEXT: him that that stands there, and kill him. How now?  \\nwho pulles mee\\ndowne from my Chariot by the haires of my head. Oh shall\\nI not fulfill Appolloes commandment? See, see, what a sharpe disease this is, and how   \\nwell he\\nwas euen now. I will fetch a Phisitian straight, before hee\\ngrow too farre into this rage. Are they both gone now? Ile then hie me away to\\nmy ship, tis time to be gone from hence. My loines ake with sitting, and mine eies with\\nlooking, while I staie for yonder laizie Phisitian: see now where\\nthe creeping drawlatch comes. What disease hath hee said you? Is it a letarge or a\\nlunacie, or melancholie, or dropsie? Wherfore I pray do I bring you, but that you shuld\\ntell me what it is? and cure him of it. Fie, make no question of that, Ile cure him I\\nwarrant ye. Oh here he comes, staie, let vs marke what he doth. Neuer in my life had I more ouerthwart fortune\\nin one day, and all by the villanie of this false knaue the\\nParasite, my Ylisses that workes such mischiefs against mee his\\nKing. But let me liue no longer, but ile be reuengde vppon\\nthe life of him: his life? nay tis my life, for hee liues by my\\nmeate and drinke, Ile vtterly withdraw the slaues life from\\nhim. And Erotium shee sheweth plainly what she is: who\\nbecause I require the cloake again to carrie to my wife, saith\\nI gaue it her, and flatly falles out with me. How\\nvnfortunate am I? Do ye heare him? He complaines of his fortune. Go to him. Menechmus , how do ye man? why keepe you not\\nyour cloake ouer your arme? It is verie hurtfull to your\\ndisease. Keepe ye warme I pray. Why hang thy selfe, what carest thou. Sir can you smell anie thing? I smell a prating dolt of thee. Oh I will haue your head throughly purged. Pray\\ntell me Menechmus , what vse you to drinke? white wine or\\nclaret? What the diuell carest thou? Looke, his fit now begins. Why doest not as well aske mee whether I eate\\nbread, or cheese, or beefe, or porredge, or birdes that beare\\nfeathers, or fishes that haue finnes. See what idle talke he falleth into. Tarry, I will aske him further.\\nMenechmus , tell me, be not your eyes heauie and dull\\nsometimes? What doest thinke I am an Owle? Doo not your guttes gripe ye, and croake in your\\nbelly? When I am hungrie they do, else not. He speakes not like a mad man in that. Sleepe ye\\nsoundly all night? When I haue paid my debts I do. The mischiefe\\nlight on thee, with all thy friuolous questions. Oh now he rageth vpon those words, take heed. Oh this is nothing to the rage he was in euen now.\\nHe called his wife bitch, and all to nought. Did I ? Thou didst, mad fellow, and threatenedst to ryde\\nouer me here with a Chariot and horses, and to kill mee, and\\nteare me in peeces. This thou didst, I know what I say. I say, thou stolest Iupiters Crowne from   \\nhis head,\\n\\nand thou wert whipt through the Towne for it, and that\\nthou hast kild thy father, and beaten thy mother. Doo ye\\nthinke I am so mad that I cannot deuise as notable lyes of\\nyou, as you do of me? Maister Doctor, pray heartily make speede to cure\\nhim, see ye not how mad he waxeth? Ile tell ye, hee shall be brought ouer to my house,\\nand there will I cure him. Is that best? What else, there I can order him as I list. Well, it shall be so. Oh sir, I will make yee take neesing powder this\\ntwentie dayes. Ile beate yee first with a bastanado, this thirtie\\ndayes. Fetch men to carry him to my house. How many will serue the turne? Being no madder then hee is now, foure will\\nserue. Ile fetch them, staie you with him maister Doctor. No by my faith, Ile goe home to make readie all\\nthings needfull. Let your men bring him hither. I go. Are they both gone? Good Gods what meaneth\\nthis? These men say I am mad, who without doubt are mad\\nthemselues. I stirre not, I fight not, I am not sicke. I speake\\nto them, I know them. Well what were I now best to do? I\\nwould goe home, but my wife shuttes me foorth a doores.\\nErotium is as farre out with me too. Euen here I will rest me\\ntill the euening, I hope by that time, they will take pittie\\non me. * The proofe of a good seruant, is to regard his maisters\\nbusinesse as well in his absence, as in his presence: and I\\nthinke him a verie foole that is not carefull as well for his\\n\\nribbes and shoulders, as for his belly and throate. When I\\nthink vpon the rewards of a sluggard, I am euer pricked with\\na carefull regard of my backe and shoulders: for in truth I\\nhaue no fancie to these blows, as many a one hath: methinks\\nit is no pleasure to a man to be basted with a ropes end two\\nor three houres togither. I haue prouided yonder in the \\nTowne, for all our marriners, and safely bestowed all my\\nmasters Trunkes and fardels: and am now comming to see\\nif he be yet got forth of this daungerous gulfe, where I feare\\nme is ouer plunged, pray God he be not ouerwhelmed and\\nSOURCE TEXT: ouerwhelmed and and past helpe ere I come. Before Gods and men, I charge and commaund you sirs,\\nto execute with great care that which I appoint you: if yee\\nloue the safetie of your owne ribbes and shoulders, then goe\\ntake me vp my sonne in lawe, laie all hands vpon him, why\\nstand ye stil? what do ye doubt? I saie, care not for his\\nthreatnings, nor for anie of his words. Take him vp and bring him\\nto the Phisitions house: I will go thither before. What newes? how now masters? what will ye do\\nwith me? why do ye thus beset me? whither carrie ye mee?\\nHelpe, helpe, neighbors, friends, Citizens. O Iupiter , what do I see? my maister abused  \\nby a\\ncompanie of varlets. Is there no good man will helpe me? Helpe ye maister? yes the villaines shall haue my\\nlife before they shall thus wrong ye. Tis more fit I should\\nbe kild, then you thus handled. Pull out that rascals eye that\\nholds ye about the necke there. I'le clout these peasants, out\\nye rogue, let go ye varlet. I haue hold of this villaines eie. Pull it out, and let the place appeare in his head.\\nAway ye cutthroat theeues, ye murtherers. O, O, ay, ay, Away, get ye hence, ye mongrels, ye dogs. Will ye\\n\\nbe gone? Thou raskall behind there, ile giue thee somewhat\\nmore, take that. It was time to come maister, you had bene\\nin good case if I had not bene heere now, I tolde you what\\nwould come of it. Now as the gods loue me, my good friend I thank\\nthee: thou hast done that for me which I shall neuer be able\\nto requite. I'le tell ye how sir, giue me my freedome. Should I giue it thee? Seeing you cannot requite my good turne. Thou art deceiued man. Wherein? On mine honestie, I am none of thy maister,    \\nI had\\nneuer yet anie seruant would do so much for me. Why then bid me be free: will you? Yea surelie, be free, for my part. O sweetly spoken, thanks my good maister. Messenio ,  we are all glad of your   \\ngood\\nfortune. O maister, ile call ye maister still, I praie vse \\nme in\\nanie seruice as ye did before, ile dwell with you still, & when\\nye go home, ile wait vpon you. Nay, nay, it shall not need. Ile goe staight to the Inne and deliuer vp my\\naccounts, and all your stuffe: your purse is lockt vp safely\\nsealed in the casket, as you gaue it mee. I will goe fetch it to\\nyou. Do, fetch it. I will. I was neuer thus perplext. Some deny me to be him\\nthat I am, and shut me out of their doores. This fellow saith\\nhe is my bondman, and of me he begs his freedome: he will\\nfetch my purse and monie: well if he bring it, I will receiue\\nit, and set him free, I would he would so go his way. My old\\nfather in lawe, and the Doctor saie I am mad, who euer sawe\\nsuch straunge demeanors? well though Erotium be neuer so\\n\\nangrie, yet once againe ile go see if by intreatie I can get the\\ncloake on her to carrie to my wife. Impudent knaue, wilt thou say that I euer saw thee\\nsince I sent thee away to day, and bad thee come for mee\\nafter dinner? Ye make me starke mad: I tooke ye away and\\nreskued ye from foure great bigboand villaines, that were\\ncarrying ye away euen heere in this place. Heere they had ye\\nvp, you cried, Helpe, helpe, I came running to you, you\\nand I togither beate them away by maine force. Then for\\nmy good turne and faithfull seruice, ye gaue mee my\\nfreedome: I tolde ye I would go fetch your Casket, now in the\\nmean time you ranne some other way to get before me, and\\nso you denie it all againe. I gaue thee thy freedome? You did. When I giue thee thy freedome, Ile be a bondman\\nmy selfe: go thy wayes. Whewe, marry I thanke ye for nothing. Forsworne Queanes, sweare till your hearts ake, and your\\neyes fall out, ye shall neuer make me beleeue that I carried\\nhence either cloake or chaine. O heauens, maister what do I see? What? Your ghoast. What ghoast? Your Image, as like you as can be possible. Surely not much vnlike me as I thinke. O my good friend and helper, well met: thanks\\nfor thy late good helpe. Sir, may I craue to know your name? I were too blame if I should not tell thee anie\\nthing, my name is Menechmus . Nay my friend, that is my name. I am of Syracusis in Sicilia . So am I. Are you a Syracusan ? I am. O, ho, I know ye: this is my maister, I thought hee\\nthere, had bene my maister, and was proffering my seruice to\\nhim, pray pardon me sir, if I said any thing I should not. Why doating patch, didst thou not come with\\nme this morning from the ship? My faith he saies true, this is my maister, you may\\ngo looke ye a man: God saue ye maister: you sir farewell.\\nThis is Menechmus . I say that I am Menechmus . What a iest is this? Are you Menechmus ? Euen Menechmus the sonne of Moschus . My fathers sonne? Friend, I go about neither to take your   \\nfather\\nnor your country from you. O immortall Gods, let it fall out as I hope, and  \\nfor\\nmy life these are the two Twinnes, all things agree so iump\\ntogither. I will speake to my maister. Menechmus ? What wilt thou? I call ye not both, but which of you came     \\nwith me\\nfrom the ship? Not I. I did. Then I call you. Come hither. Whats the matter? This same is either some notable cousening\\nIugler, or else it is your brother whom we seeke. I neuer sawe\\none man so like an other, water to water, nor milke to milke,\\nis not liker then he is to you. Indeed I thinke thou saiest true. Finde it\\n \\nthat he is my brother, and I here promise thee thy freedom. Well, let me about it. Heare ye sir, you say your\\nname is Menechmus ? I do. So is this mans. You are of Syracusis ? True. So is he. Moscus was your father? He was. So was he his. What will you say, if I find that ye\\nare brethren and twins? I would thinke it happie newes. Nay staie maisters both, I meane to haue the honor\\nof this exploit. Answere me: your name is Menechmus ? Yea. And yours? And mine. You are of Syracusis ? I am. And I. Well, this goeth right thus farre. What is the\\nfarthest thing that you remember there? How I went with my father to Turentum ,   \\nto a\\ngreat mart, and there in the preasse I was stolne from him. O Iupiter ! Peace, what exclaiming is this? How old were ye\\nthen? About seuen yeare old, for euen then I shedde\\nteeth, and since that time, I neuer heard of anie of my\\nkindred. Had ye neuer a brother? Yes, as I remember, I heard them say, we were\\ntwo twinnes. O Fortune! Tush, can ye not be quiet? Were ye both of one\\nname? Nay (as I think) they cald my brother,        \\nSosicles . It is he, what need farther proofe?\\nO Brother, Brother, let me embrace thee. Sir, if this be true, I am wonderfully glad,  \\nbut\\nhow is it, that ye are called Menechmus ? When it was tolde vs that you and our father\\nwere both dead, our Graundsire (in memorie of my fathers\\nname) chaungde mine to Menechmus . Tis verie like he would do so indeed. But let \\nme\\naske ye one question more, what was our mothers name? Theusimarche. Brother, the most welcome man to mee, that\\nthe world holdeth. I ioy, and ten thousand ioyes the more, hauing\\ntaken so long trauaile and huge paines to seeke you. See now, how all this matter comes about. This it\\nwas, that the Gentlewoman had ye in to dinner, thinking it\\nhad bene he. True it is, I willed a dinner to be prouided  \\nfor\\nme heere this morning, and I also brought hither closely a\\ncloake of my wiues, and gaue it to this woman. Is not this the same, Brother? How came you by this? This woman met me, had me in to dinner,\\nenterteined me most kindly, and gaue me this cloake, and this\\nChaine. Indeed she tooke ye for mee: and I beleeue I\\nhaue bene as straungely handled by occasion of your\\ncomming. You shall haue time inough to laugh at all these\\nmatters hereafter. Do ye remember maister, what ye\\npromised me? Brother I will intreate you to performe   \\nyour\\npromise to Messenio , he is worthie of it. I am content. Io Tryumphe. Brother, will ye now go with me to            \\nSyracusis ? So soone as I can sell away such goods as I\\npossesse here in Epidamnum , I will go with you. Thanks my good Brother. Messenio , plaie thou the Crier for me,   \\nand make\\na proclamation. A fit office. Come on. O yes.\\nWhat day shall your sale be? This day sennight. All men, women and children, in Epidamnum , or\\nelsewhere, that will repaire to Menechmus house this day\\nsenight, shall there finde all maner of things to sell: seruaunts,\\nhoushold stuffe, house, ground SOURCE TEXT: gronnd , and all: so \\nthey bring readie\\nmoney.\\nWill ye sell your wife too sir?

Dr. Addington further deposed, that\\nMr. Blandy told him, that he suspected\\nhe had taken Poison, and that he believed\\nit came to his Daughter with the Scotch\\nPebbles, for he was always worse after a\\nPresent of those damned Scotch Pebbles\\nwere received, and besides, that he\\nremembered to have heard Cranston talk\\nvery learnedly upon Poisons; that when\\nhe, this Witness, asked Mr. Blandy who\\nhe imagined gave him this Poison, he\\nreplied, with Tears in his Eyes, though\\nwith a forced Smile, He was then asked by the King's\\nCouncil, if he was sure that the Poison\\nthe Deceased had taken, was the Cause\\nof his Death; Dr. Addington replied, he\\nwas sure that it was. Benjamin Norton , Apothecary, at\\nHenley upon Thames , deposed, That he was\\ncalled to Mr. Blandy, Tuesday August 6th. and\\nfound him complaining of a violent Pain\\nin his Stomach and Bowles, attended\\nwith a violent Purging and Vomiting;\\nthat on the Thursday Morning following\\nSusannah Gunnell sent to him, and said she\\n\\nshould be glad to consult about some\\nWater-Gruel which she had left with Mrs.\\nMountney , which was the Remainder of what\\nMr. Blandy her Master had eat part of;\\nthat he went and examin'd it, and\\nbeing ask'd by them, if he knew what it\\nwas that was in it, he answer'd them,\\nhe could not be very possitive; but let\\nit be what it would, he was sure it could\\nnot have any Business there; that he\\ntook it from the Gruel upon some white\\nPaper, and left it with Mrs. Mountney to\\ndry; that when it was dry, he burnt\\nPart of it with a hot Poker, and said it\\nappear'd to him to be of the Arsnic Kind;\\nand that another Part of it he had\\ndeliver'd to Dr. Addington ; and the\\nRemainder he produc'd in Court, seal'd up\\nunder the Seals of the Earl of\\nMacclesfield and Lord Cadagan . Mary Mountney being sworn, said, That\\non the 8th of August last, Susannah\\nGunnell came to her House, and brought a\\nPan with some Gruel in it, and desired\\nthis Witness to look at it, for she\\nfeared there was something in it that should\\nnot be; that upon this Witness's\\nlooking at it, she was of the same Opinion;\\nthat Gunnell left the Pan with the Gruel\\nin it with her, desiring this Witness to\\nshew it to Mr. Norton the Apothecary,\\nand desire his Opinion of it; that this\\nWitness did shew it to Mr. Norton ,\\nwho inspected it, and said, that\\nwhatever it was, it had no Business there ; that\\nMr. Norton desired some white Paper,\\nwhich she gave him; that then Mr.\\nNorton took the Sedement at the Bottom,\\nput it on the Paper, and gave it to this\\nWitness to keep till it was dry; that\\nthen this Witness locked it up, till the\\n11th of the same Month, and then\\ndeliver'd it to Mr. Norton . Susannah Gunnell , the Chamber-maid,\\nbeing call'd and sworn, said, That on\\nMonday the 5th of August last her\\nMaster was not very well, and desired to\\nhave some Water-gruel before he laid\\ndown; that Miss Blandy , the Prisoner at\\nthe Bar, carried him about half a Pint,\\nwhich he drank, and was immediately\\nsick, and call'd for a Bason to be brought\\nup to his Room; and that she, this\\nWitness, carry'd up a clean one: Being\\nask'd if he had made Use of it, she\\nanswered Yes, and discharg'd into it about\\nhalf a Pint; that he complain'd of\\nviolent Pains in his Stomach and Bowels;\\nthat next Morning he sent for Mr. Norton ,\\nwho gave him something, and he was\\neasier; that in the Afternoon Robert\\nHarman brought Orders from his Master\\nto have a little Water-gruel warm'd\\ninstantly; that she warm'd it accordingly,\\nand the Prisoner carried it to her Father;\\nthat he drank that also, and was\\nimmediately affected in the same Manner as\\nbefore, but more violently; that on\\nWednesday Morning her Master took Physick,\\nand Miss told her, her Father would want\\nWater-gruel; and on this Witness's\\nsaying she would leave her Ironing and make\\nsome, Miss Blandy reply'd, that thinking that too stale,\\nand having tasted it the Day before, and\\nimagining it tasted ill, she went and tasted\\nit a second Time, when, upon lifting the\\nPan to her Mouth, she observ'd a white\\nSettling at the Bottom; and that upon\\nseeing it so white, she felt it between\\nher Finger and Thumb, and found it\\ngritty; that she then went into the\\nKitchen to Betty Binfield , the Cook-maid,\\nand desired she would look at it, for the\\nOatmeal was very white; that Betty\\nsaid answered this Witness, that\\nthis Witness then took it to the Door,\\nwhen it appear'd still more white;\\nwhereupon she immediately recollected\\nthat she had been told that Poison was\\nwhite and gritty; and it then came into\\nher Mind, that her Master's Disorder\\nwas occasioned by Poison? and she\\nimmediately took the Pan to Mrs.\\nMountney , told her what she suspected, and\\ndesired her to shew it to Mr. Norton the\\nApothecary: Being ask'd who she\\nbelieved put that white Stuff into the Gruel,\\nshe said the Prisoner: Being asked why\\nshe suspected her, reply'd, that the\\nMonday before, when the Gruel was made,\\nMiss Blandy was some Time in the\\nPantry stirring it, and then coming into\\nthe Kitchen, she said, That on Friday the 9th, she told Mr.\\nStevens , her Master's Brother-in-law,\\nwhat she suspected, and desired him to\\nacquaint her Master, who said, that he\\ncould not bear to do it; that she\\ncontinued very uneasy, and on Saturday\\nMorning the 10th came to a Resolution\\nto acquaint her Master herself, which she\\naccordingly did, and begg'd he would\\nlet his Daughter see him as little as \\npossible; that he accordingly forbid her\\nfrom coming into his Chamber; and then\\nsaid, That on Monday , at Miss's Request, her\\nFather consented to see her; that she,\\nthis Witness, was present when Miss\\ncame into her Chamber, and fell down\\nupon her Knees, and said, To which Mr. Blandy reply'd, Upon this Miss said, he\\nreply'd, Miss then declared\\nshe was innocent of his Illness, when\\nthis Witness reply'd, she was afraid she\\nwas not quite innocent, and that some\\nof the Powder was in such Hands as \\nwould appear against her. Elizabeth Binfield , the Cook-Maid, depos'd,\\nThat on Monday the 5th of August last, a Pan\\n\\nof Water-gruel was made for her Master, the\\nDeceased Mr. Blandy ; that Miss Blandy , the\\nPrisoner at the Bar, came into the Kitchen, and\\nsaid, That\\nthat Evening her Master had some of the Gruel,\\nand was taken very ill after it; that the next\\nDay Mr. Norton the Apothecary was sent for,\\nand that toward the Evening her Master was\\nbetter; but the next Day he drank some\\nmore Gruel, and was worse than before, with\\nvomiting and purging, and complain'd that he\\nhad a Ball of Fire in his Guts. That the\\nnext Day, Wednesday, Susan Gunnell brought\\na Pan with some Gruel in it into the Kitchen,\\nand said, that this Witness reply'd, that Susan said, that\\nthen Susan took the Pan to Mrs. Mountney's .\\nThat the Friday after, her Master and Miss\\nwere in the Kitchen, her Master said to this\\nWitness, which being informed of, he replied, continued he, That Miss seemed\\nmuch surprized, but with a forced Smile, said, and went away immediately. Mr. Littleton , Mr. Blandy's Clerk, being\\nnext call'd and sworn, said, That he had been\\nout of Henley to visit his Father in\\nWarwickshire , and on his Return on Saturday Morning\\nthe 10th of August last, he breakfasted with\\nhis Master, the Deceased, and the Prisoner,\\nand found his Master much disordered; that\\nMiss poured out a Dish of Tea for her Father,\\nwhich he disliked, and said to her, upon which she\\nseemed confused, and seemed to have a Tremor on\\nher, and went out of the Room; that the\\nDeceased then took the Cup with the Tea, and\\npoured it into the Cat's Bason, that stood in\\nthe Window, and went away, and would eat\\nno more Breakfast; that then Miss came into\\nthe Room to this Witness, and ask'd him what\\nher Father had said, and he told her, that her\\nFather had thrown the Tea into the Cat's Bason;\\n\\nand that he had left the Room, seemingly\\ndispleased, and would not eat any more\\nBreakfast, but that he had said nothing. The next\\nDay he, this Witness, went to Church, but\\nMiss did not; and when he came Home, Miss\\nasked him to take a Walk with her and her\\nFather in the Garden. As they went into \\nthe Garden, she put a Letter into his Hand,\\nand desired him to direct it as usual to Capt.\\nCranston , and put it into the Post; but he\\nhearing that his Master was poisoned, and\\nMiss suspected, he broke the Letter open,\\nread it, and then carried it to his Master,\\nwho said, Richard Fisher was next called and sworn,\\nwho said he was on the Coroner's Inquest, and\\non hearing that Miss Blandy was gone to the\\nAngel , he went after her; that he spoke with\\n\\nher there, and ask'd her if she would not\\nreturn home with him; she answer'd yes, but\\nshe was afraid of being insulted by the Mob,\\nand begg'd he would protect her; that upon\\nthis he got a close Post Chaise and brought her\\nhome; that upon her coming to her Father's \\nHouse, and talking of the Affair, she ask'd\\nhim what could be done for her; that he\\nanswer'd if she could produce any Thing that\\nwould fix it upon Cranston , possibly she might\\nbe sav'd; that upon this, in some Agony, she\\nanswer'd, that there being a Gentlewoman there who\\nbetter knew the House than himself, he\\ndeclin'd going, and desir'd her to search; that\\nshe did accordingly, but could find nothing of\\nConsequence. Mrs. Lane being called and sworn, said, that\\nshe went into the Angel to her Husband, who\\nwas there, and Miss Blandy was with him;\\nthat she heard her Husband say to the Prisoner,\\nwhen she first went in, that upon this,\\nMiss Blandy stamped upon the Floor, in a\\nseeming Agony, and said, Then turning about, after a short\\nPause, said, Mr. Lane was then called and sworn, who\\nsaid he was at the Angel , with Miss Blandy ,\\nand talking with her concerning her Father's\\nDeath, she asked him what he thought would\\n\\nbe done to her; that he made her for Answer,\\nthat she would be sent to Oxford-Castle, and be\\ntryed at the Assizes, and if she was innocent, she\\nwould be acquitted, and if she was guilty, she\\nwould be punished according to Law ; that Miss\\nthen stamped on the Floor, and said, that the Town Serjeant\\ncoming in just at that Juncture took off his\\nAttention to what she said more. Here the Council for the Crown, tho' they\\nhad many more Witnesses to call, rested their\\nProof against the Prisoner, and she was\\nthereupon called to make her Defence. Then she desired the following Witnesses\\nmight be call'd in her Defence. Ann James being sworn, said, That she\\nfrequently went as a Chairwoman to work at the\\ndeceased Mr. Blandy's ; and being there one\\nDay, she heard Elizabeth Binfield say, meaning the Prisoner at the\\nBar, Being asked by the King's Council when\\nand where it was, and who were present when\\nthe Words were spoken, she said Mary Banks\\nand one Deane ; and that they were said in the\\nKitchen of the late Mr. Blandy's House, in\\nHenley , but she could not recollect the Day;\\nbut it was after Miss Blandy was sent to\\nOxford Castle. Here Elizabeth Binfield was call'd again by\\nthe King's Council, and confronted with this\\nEvidence, who deny'd that she had ever said\\nany such Words, or had any ill Will against\\nMiss Blandy . Mary Banks was next call'd and sworn, who\\nsaid, That she heard Elizabeth Binfield , the\\nCook Maid, say, Being asked by the King's Council when,\\nand where the Words where spoke, she said in\\nMr. Blandy's House at Henley , and on the Day\\nhis Body was open'd. Here it was observed, that there was a\\nmaterial Difference in the Evidence of these two\\nWitnesses, the swearing possitively to the\\nDay the Body was open'd, and the other that\\nthe Words were said after Miss Blandy was in\\nOxford Castle, which was not till after her\\nFather's Remains were buried. Edward Hearne was next call'd and sworn,\\nwho said, that he had lived with the Deceased\\n\\nformerly, but was now Clerk of Henley Parish;\\nthat he frequently went to Mr. Blandy's House,\\nperhaps four or five Times a Week; that he\\nalways observ'd a cordial Duty from Miss\\nto her Father; and that he never saw any\\nMark of Undutifulness or Misbehaviour\\ntowards her Father. The Prisoner's Council then ask'd this\\nWitness, if in the whole Conversation at that\\nTime, he did not understand the Prisoner to\\nmean only the Punishment of being\\nimprisoned there; and whether she did not at that\\nTime persist in her Innocence, as to the Crime\\nshe stood charged with; when the Witness\\nsaid, that he did understand it only as the\\nPunishment of being confined, and that she\\nalways insisted on her Innocence. Thomas Cawley being sworn, said, That he\\nfrequently visited at Mr. Blandy's , as Mr.\\nBlandy and his Daughter did his Family; and\\nthat he always observed a dutiful and\\naffectionate Carriage from Miss to her Father. Thomas Staverton was next sworn, who said,\\nThat he had a House next Door to the\\nDeceased, that was repairing, and therefore he, as\\nbeing acquainted in Mr. Blandy's Family, used\\nfrequently to call there, and that he always\\nobserved Miss to shew the greatest Mark of\\nDuty and Affection to her Father. He further said, that about four Months\\nbefore the Death of Mr. Blandy , Miss was\\nvisiting at his House, when she said, that her\\nFather she believed would not marry again, let\\nwhat advantagious Offers soever be made\\nto him, till such Time as he had settled her\\nin the World: And that he had observed for\\nsome Time past, his old Friend the Deceased,\\nhad shrunk very much; and that he had often\\nthought and said, that he did not think his old\\nFriend Mr. Blandy would live long. Mrs. Davis , Landlady of the Angel, was\\nthen call'd and sworn, who said, that she\\nseeing Miss Blandy going over the Bridge, with\\na Mob after her, asked her where she was\\ngoing, when she made her for Answer, that\\nher Father was going to be opened, and that\\nshe could not stand the Shock, so was taking\\na Walk in the Air; that this Witness then\\nasked her to go into her House to shelter\\nherself from the Insults of the Mob, which Miss\\naccordingly did. She was then ask'd particularly, if she\\nthought she was endeavouring to get off, and\\nshe said no, she did not, nor was it apparent to\\nher in any wise to think so. Robert Stoke was then call'd and sworn, who\\nsaid, he being the Town Serjeant, was order'd\\nto go over the Bridge to the Angel , to stop\\nMiss Blandy , the Prisoner; that when he spoke\\nto her, she seemed very willing to return, and\\nwas glad of any Protection to keep her from\\nthe Insolence of the Mob.  \n",

The Method that we took was, that Mr. Day , Mr.    \\nOsman and myself were to\\nconceal our selves in a Closet, adjoining to the Room where Mr.      \\nLyddel lay, and on the\\n\\n8th of November last, about six in the Morning, we all placed    \\nour selves there; I cannot   \\nstay with you now ; O God ! Dear Matthews do not ruin me ; Do not ruin me ; What do you        \\nsay ? Sir, I thought you could not have been guilty of so foul    \\nan Act . For you, Sir, to come so frequently, in such a Shew of   \\nFriendship, and to wrong his\\nLordship after such a Manner as you have done, is a Crime for which  \\nyou can make him no\\nSatisfaction ; it is very true, \\nI can make no Satisfaction . Be sure when you come into the Room; and if you  \\nfind my Wife there, I\\ndesire she may be used tenderly ; That in case we take them together in the  \\nManner we found them; that then\\nI should come to Town, and give Orders to Mr. Staples to proceed \\nagainst SOURCE TEXT: againg him according to\\nLaw . we proposed early the next Morning to go    \\ninto a Closet that joined\\nto the Room where Mr. Lyddel lay, which we accordingly did; Are your Rasors ready, for I shall shave my self    \\nby and by ? So then ! I shall be ruined , but we told her we were there by \\nhis Lordship's Direction; What is the Matter? I \\nhave heard nothing you have\\nsaid , We come to observe the vile  \\nTreatment you have used towards\\nmy Lord, and for this you can never give his Lordship                 \\nSatisfaction . It is very true,\\nI'll take my Horse and go away, and never return more ; You had as good stay while you are here , I\\nam a vile Wretch; for God's Sake do not speak to me; for God's Sake  \\ndo not speak to me .

That \\nwhen he went into\\nthe Country he had several Pair of Leases to engross for his Lord's  \\nTenants; that the\\nAppartment he lay in was under Mr. SOURCE TEXT: Mr, Lyddel's \\nRoom, called the White Room ; that one Morning,\\nas he was engrossing of Leases, he heard a Woman coming into that    \\nWhite Room ; that he\\nWORD REPEATED: he heard the Voice of a Man, and presently heard  \\nthe White Room Bed crack. This was\\nthe first Morning, October the 13th . That he says, he heard \\na Woman come into the White\\nRoom , just over his Head; that he heard the Man, and heard the    \\nBed crack, upon which\\nthis Deponent declar'd himself to be in a great Surprize, but was    \\nresolved to see who came\\nout; that he went half way up the great Stairs, and saw Mr.          \\nLyddel coming out of his\\nRoom, That running as \\nhard as he could, he\\nmet one of his Lord's Servants, and desired him to send Mr.          \\nLyddel's Man up to his Master,\\nafter which he went up the Back-Stairs through the Long Gallery, and \\nsaw his Lady come\\nout very red, and in Disorder, and thought she had been in Mr.       \\nLyddel's Room. Being\\nasked, whether he afterwards met with her, and in what Room?         \\nReply'd, that the next\\nMorning, the 14th of October , he was then writing as        \\nbefore, and about nine a-Clock he\\nheard a Woman come in after the same Manner, and heard the Step of a \\nMan, and the Bed\\ncrack, as the Morning before; then he went up the Back-Stairs, and   \\nat the End of his Lord's\\nGallery he took off his Wig, and laid himself down, that no Body     \\nmight see him; that he\\nheard the Bolt of Mr. Lyddel's Door open, then he saw Mr.        \\nLyddel come out of his\\nChamber Door looking about him, and going in, immediately his Lady   \\ncame out, with her\\nHands spreading her Petticoats; that there was a Door at the End of  \\nthe Gallery, from\\nwhence he could see all along the Gallery.

He reply'd, that he heard the Door  \\nunbolted, and he\\nsaw Mr. Lyddel come out of his Room, and presently after he went \\nin, and his Lady came\\nout holding her Petticoats on each Side, but when he saw her he got  \\nup with a Book  in his\\nHand, as waiting his Lord's getting up in the Morning, which was his \\nknown Practice; that\\nthen his Lady went into her own Dressing-Room. Being asked, whether  \\nhis Lady came out\\nwhile Mr. Lyddel was at the Door? He reply'd, that he went in    \\nfirst, and then his Lady\\ncame out. Being ask'd why she held her Petticoats after such a       \\nManner? Reply'd, because\\nMr. Nevell , that was in a Room hard by, should not hear the     \\nrustling of her Silks. The\\nnext Day, being Wednesday , this Deponent was from Home, and     \\ncould make no\\nObservation. That on Thursday he was in his Room, and heard the  \\nsame Noise in the White Room ,\\nafter the same Manner as he had done before. In the Afternoon of the \\nsame Day he\\nacquainted Mr. Osman , his Lord's Steward, for he said he could  \\nnot bear to see his Lord\\ninjured after such a Manner. He was asked, whether Mr. Lyddel    \\ncame out of the Door and\\nlook'd about him this Time, as he had done on the Tuesday        \\nbefore? He reply'd, that he did,\\nand that his Lady came out as before, but whether she went into the  \\nNursery or into his\\nLord's Appartment he was not certain. That on Friday , as he was \\nwriting again, he\\nprevailed with Mr. Osman to be present with him, and when they   \\nwere together, he ask'd Mr.\\nOsman whether he did not hear some Body come in? He said, yes;   \\nand in a little Time they\\nheard a Bed crack; that this Deponent said to Mr. Osman , and so it happened, for they being  \\nat the Bottom of the\\ngreat Stairs; Mr. Osman told him he heard it very plain, and saw \\nthe Lady come out of Mr.\\nLyddel's Room, with her Petticoats held up by her Hand as she    \\nused to do, to prevent the\\nGentleman that lodged by her from hearing her. That Saturday     \\nMorning was the same\\nThing; that this Deponent and Mr. Osman heard and saw as before. \\nBeing ask'd what\\nMethod he took in order to have it discovered? Replied, that he      \\ndiscoursed with Mr. Osman ,\\nand they consulted together what Method they should take, that       \\nseveral Mornings they had\\nhad those Consultations; further, that he acquainted Mr. Day     \\nwith it. It being ask'd, what\\nConclusion they came to? He reply'd, it was agreed upon that their   \\nLord should know of\\nit some way or other, they propos'd the Discovery should be made by  \\nhis Lordship's\\nMother, but she was under a great deal of Concern about it, and      \\ndesired some Body else might\\ndo it; that then they thought no Person so proper as Mr. Day to  \\ndo it, who is a Neighbour\\nand Relation of his Lordship's. Mr. Day accepting of the         \\nProposal did communicate it.\\nBeing ask'd, when it was communicated to my Lord, what Answer did he \\ngive of what his\\nLordship would do? He reply'd, that Mr. Day told him, that his   \\nLordship He gave this          \\nDirection to Mr. Day and Mr.\\nOsman . that they\\nstaid there till about nine, at which Time her Ladyship came into    \\nMr. Lyddel's Room,\\nwent round it, and was heard to say with a low Voice, upon\\nwhich Mr. Day and Mr. Osman thinking her gone were for going \\naway, but this Deponent\\nacquainting them that she was not, prevailed with them to stay, and  \\nhe listning very close\\nheard a Noise, upon which they all went together into the Chamber,   \\nand coming softly to\\nthe Bed-side withdrew the Curtains, upon which Mr. Lyddel cry'd  \\nout, That this\\nDeponent saw her Ladyship in a very indecent Posture, and in a very  \\ngreat Surprize she said, upon which he said he was   \\nvery sorry for what was done,\\nshe repeated again, he told her that he was \\nsent by his Lord's Direction,\\nand that he must be true to his Lord. That Mr. Lyddel in his     \\nSurprize seem'd not to have\\nheard what was said, and therefore cry'd out, This Deponent answered\\nhim, And Mr. Osman saying\\nto him; that Mr. Lyddel replyed, Then he\\nsaid, he would take a Horse and ride away, and never return to his   \\nLordship's House any\\nmore. Then Mr. Osman said to him, it was his Lordship's          \\nDirection that he should be kept\\nthere. This Deponent being ask'd, what Room this was in? Reply'd,    \\nthat it was Mr.\\nLyddel's Room; that they lay cross the Bed when they opened the  \\nCurtains. Being asked,\\nhow many Days Mr. Lyddel was at his Lordship's at this Time? He  \\nreply'd, that he came\\nthe 7th of November . Being asked, who he received his           \\nInstructions from; He reply'd,\\nfrom Mr. Day and Mr. Osman , and that his Lordship in his    \\nInstructions said to them when\\nhe went to Bed, that this was over Night, and  \\nthey were taken together at nine\\na-Clock the next Day. Being ask'd, what Directions his Lordship gave \\nwith respect to Mr.\\nLyddel ? Reply'd, Being ask'd, what was to be done with Mr. Lyddel in    \\nthe mean while? Reply'd,\\nThat his Lordship gave Directions to secure him in the House till  \\nfurther Orders . This\\nDeponent being asked, whether he went to London after this?      \\nReplied, yes, and went to Mr.\\nStaples , and made Affidavit of what he saw, upon which there    \\nwas a Process taken out,\\nwhich this Deponent delivered to the Sheriff's Bayliff, and was      \\nexecuted on Monday\\nMorning; that then he supposes he was carry'd away to the County     \\nJail. Being asked, what Orders\\nwere given about his Lady's going? He replied, that he had no Orders \\nabout her, but she\\nwent away on the Saturday after the Discovery, very big with     \\nChild. Mr. Osman depos'd, That Mr. Matthews came to him and    \\nexpressed himself much\\nconcerned, with Relation to the Intimacies he had observed betwixt   \\nMr. Lyddel and his Lady,\\nand said, that Mr. Lyddel had abused his Lord, by lying with his \\nLady; and gave this\\nDeponent several Instances of it, as of his lighting Mr. Lyddel  \\nup into his Lady's Appartment,\\nand finding but two Candles he went down for two more, and returning \\nfound the Door\\nfast, and knocking at the Door, heard his Lady go from the Couch to  \\nthe Fire-side, that when\\nhis Lady had opened the Door she chid him for knocking so hard, that \\nhe then saw Mr.\\nLyddel with his Hands in the Folds of his Clothes, and believed  \\nhe was putting up his Breeches:\\nThis was the 12th of October . On the 13th of October , as   \\nhe was sitting in his Room\\nengrossing of Leases, he heard the Tread of a Man, then the Tread of \\na Woman, and in a\\nlittle Time after heard the Bed crack, and being willing to be       \\nbetter satisfy'd, he went out\\nof his Room, and went up the great Stairs, and when he was half way  \\nup, Mr. Lyddel came\\nout of his Chamber, and ordered him to call his Man to him, but      \\nmeeting with one of his\\nFellow-Servants delivered the Message to him, afterwards he took to  \\na back Pair of Stairs,\\nand met his Lady just against the Nursery Room, the back Part of the \\nGallery, in very\\ngreat Disorder, and that he believed she had been in Mr.             \\nLyddel's Room. This Deponent\\nfurther says, that Mr. Matthews told him, that (the next Day     \\nbeing Wednesday he was out\\nof the way) on Thursday Morning Mr. Lyddel and his Lady had  \\nthe same\\nConversation as before; then Mr. Matthews desired this Deponent, \\nthat he would be with\\nhim the next Morning, being Friday , accordingly he went to Mr.  \\nMatthew's Room in the\\nMorning, and had not been there long but he heard a softly Tread     \\ncoming out of the\\nGreen Room into Mr. Lyddel's Bed-Chamber, and in a little Time   \\nhe heard the Bed\\ncrack pretty often; that Mr. Matthews carry'd this Deponent to   \\nthe Bottom of the great\\nStairs, where he heard the Door unbolt, and Mr. Lyddel step out, \\nas he supposed, to see\\nwhether all was clear, and after he was gone in, the Lady came out   \\nwith her Petticoats up,\\nwhich he supposed was to keep them from rustling, there being a      \\nGentleman lying in a\\nRoom on the other Side of the Gallery, at the Top of the great       \\nStairs. This Deponent\\n\\nfurther said, that he heard the same on Saturday Morning as he   \\nhad done before; that he was\\nvery much concerned and surprized at the Observation of these        \\nPassages, and to find his\\nLord abused after so gross a Manner, for he believed, that his       \\nLordship was a tender a\\nHusband, and had as great a Value for his wife as any Person in the  \\nworld, and that none\\ncould be more fond; and though they knew it would be a great         \\nAffliction to their Lord,\\nwere notwithstanding resolv'd to acquaint him with it, for they      \\ncould have no Peace in\\ntheir own Consciences while they kept it as a Secret from him; to    \\nwhich End Mr. Day\\nwas acquainted with it, he accepted of the Office, and acquainted    \\nhis Lordship with it on\\nthe sixth of November last, after this Manner; \"He desired his   \\nLordship would be pleased\\nto walk in the Fields with him, for he had something to communicate  \\nto him, but his\\nLordship being very pressing to know what it was, Mr. Day        \\nopened it to him; his\\nLordship was extreamly concerned that his Friend had done such a     \\nThing, and said He could\\nnot have done so to him .\" Then his Lordship gave Directions to    \\nmake Discovery, which\\nwas after this Manner: that this Deponent being\\nplaced against the Closet Door could see the Room, and had such a    \\na Command of it that no\\nBody could go in or come out but what he must see; that a little     \\nafter eight a-Clock Mr.\\nLyddel's Man went into the Room, and as he was coming out, his   \\nMaster being in Bed,\\nsays to him, Then the Man went\\nout of the Room, and at nine a-Clock his Lady came along the Gallery \\nto Mr. Lyddel's\\nDoor, and entered the Chamber; that he saw her through the Key-hole, \\nwhen she came\\nagainst it she made a Stop, and then went to Mr. Lyddel's        \\nBed-side, and said something\\nto him; then she returned, which made this Deponent conclude she was \\ngone quite away,\\nlikewise Mr. Day said she was gone, but Mr. Matthews was of  \\nanother Mind, and went\\nand opened Mr. Lyddel's Door, and stept to the Bed and undrew    \\nthe Curtains of the \\nBed-side, and said, the Lady was lying upon her    \\nBack a-cross the Bed, and her Clothes\\nby that Time this Deponent came was down to her Knees, that he saw   \\nher Legs; and that\\nMr. Lyddel had nothing but his Shirt on; that she used several   \\nExpressions in great Surprize,\\nand said, that\\nMr. Lyddel raised himself up and said, Then this Deponent said, He said, upon     \\nwhich this Deponent said, Being desired to     \\ngive an Account of the Friendship\\nwhich was between his Lordship and Mr. Lyddel , he said, that    \\nthe Friendship was very great,\\nthat his Lordship always received Mr. Lyddel with a great deal   \\nof Pleasure and Satisfaction,\\nthat there was as good a Provision made for him by his Lordship, as  \\nfor any Body that came\\nto his House, that it was his Opinion that his Lordship's Secrets    \\nwere communicated to him,\\nand that he never knew of greater Friendship and Intimacy than there \\nwas betwixt his\\nLordship and Mr. Lyddel . Being asked, when her Ladyship went    \\naway after the Discovery? He\\nreply'd, She went away at three a-Clock the Day of Discovery, by his \\nLordship's Order, to\\nGeneral Tatton her Father. Mr. James depos'd, That at the Desire of the Lady, he went  \\ninto Mr. Lyddel's Room on\\nSaturday Morning, on the 8th of November last, after the     \\nDiscovery was made, that when\\nhe came into the Room he found Mr. Lyddel in a great Confusion   \\nand Disorder, saying Mr. Day deposed, That he was his Lordship's Steward, and    \\ntook Care of his Estates in\\nseveral Counties, that he observed the Intimacy between his Lord and \\nMr. Lyddel , and in\\nhis Esteem his Lordship was the greatest Friend Mr. Lyddel had   \\nin the world, that there was\\nas intire Friendship betwixt them as ever was amongst Men, and that  \\ntheir mutual\\nRespect for each other was very strong, so that this Deponent was    \\nsurprized when Mr.\\nMatthews let him into some of the Secrets of his Lady and Mr.    \\nLyddel's Intimacy, the first of\\nwhich was about the Month of March last; that he could not       \\nconceive that Mr. Lyddel\\nwould be guilty of so foul a Crime, when he knew the Intimacy that   \\nwas between his\\nLord and him; he could not give Credit to those Reports till the     \\nAccount they gave him\\nof the Observations they made in the five Mornings, that then this   \\nDeponent did believe it,\\nand that they fixed upon him to discover it to his Lordship, which   \\nhe did upon the 6th of\\nNovember ; that he asked his Lordship, Whether, considering    \\nthe great Affection he had for\\nhis Lady, he could bear the Discovery of it ? That this Deponent   \\nproposed the Method of the\\nDiscovery which his Lordship approved of, and what he did by his     \\nLordship's Orders. The Council for the Defendant acknowledged, that a Verdict      \\nought to be given against\\nthe Defendant, but used divers Arguments for Mitigation of the       \\nDamages, as that the\\nDamages ought to be proportioned to the Circumstances of the Person  \\noffending, that it lies\\n\\nbefore the Jury, to give more or less, according to Circumstances    \\nThat the Defendant's\\nEstate is only an Estate for Life, and under great Incumbrances.     \\nAnother Argument was\\noffered, that this Action was not laid for an Assault in debauching  \\nthe Plaintiff's Lady, but for\\ndestroying the Health, Satisfaction and Comfort of the Plaintiff,    \\nthat from the Time the\\nFact was committed to the Time of her Death, was so short, that the  \\nInjury his Lordship\\nsustain'd in his Health could not be very great. Another Argument    \\nwas the Lady's coming\\ninto Mr. Lyddel's Chamber, by which Means she became a           \\nTemptation to him, and was\\na Temptation hard to be resisted; That this Fact between Mr.         \\nLiddel and the Lady might\\nhave been as well prevented as discovered, if they had thought fit,  \\nbut that it seem'd as if\\nan Agreement was made to lay a Snare and Temptation to draw him into \\na Criminal Action.\\nAnother Argument is, that his present Affliction is a great          \\nPunishment to him, and that even\\nthe witnesses for the Plaintiff say, that he thought himself the     \\nmost miserable wretch living,\\nand if so, then what must his Affliction be now, that he ought to be \\nconsidered as a very\\nunfortunate and unhappy Person, upon which Account there is no       \\nReason to charge much\\nDamages, as to be the total Ruin of him who is miserable enough      \\nalready. There were several Lords and Gentlemen appear'd to his          \\nReputation, who gave him the\\nCharacter of a very civil, modest, well-bred Gentleman, and could    \\nnever have thought he\\nwould have been guilty of any Thing of this Nature. There were       \\nseveral Mortgage Deeds\\nproduced in Court, upon the Estate of the Defendant, amounting to    \\n11000 l. The Council for the Plaintiff in their Reply urged, That the    \\nDamage ought not to be\\ncalculated from the Time the Fact was committed to his Lady's Death, \\nthe Consideration of\\nthe Damages ought to regard Futurity; that when once the Ties of     \\nmutual Love is broken,\\nit can never be repaired; and if they had not been detected they     \\nmight have gone on with\\nImpunity. As to the Plea made Use of, that his Estate is not capable \\nof paying large\\nDamages, a Case was mentioned of a Footman for the like Crime, who   \\nwas fined 5000 l. for\\nit is but reasonable, if a Person destroys the Happiness of another  \\nhis Happiness ought to be\\ndisturbed as long as he lives. There is a standing Law against       \\nAdultery, the Adulteress and\\nAdulterer too is to be put to Death. There is nothing here can make  \\nSatisfaction but a\\nPecuniary Punishment. Upon the whole the Jury withdrew, and after a short Stay        \\nbrought in their Verdict for\\nthe Plaintiff, 10000 l. Damages.  \n",

hope the admiral is not kill'd. do Pallisser. I wish it was over. If I go\\ndown, these five sail will tear me to pieces and we had better stay for the ships\\ncoming up a-stern. if\\nit is the admiral's orders I will bear down among\\n\\nthe middle of them, tho' they will tear me\\nto pieces, and therefore I think it will be better\\nto stay for the ships coming up a-stern, and then\\nto go down together. it will be all over with us\\npresently, we shall have no reason to sing; 'There will be the Dorsetshire and us\\nfor that ship a-stern of the Real;' the devil's in it if we be not\\nenough for her ourselves. 'Tack sir! the\\nship will not stay, we must wear after the\\nadmiral.' I ran forward and bid them hoist the jib. 'What\\nwould it have been if we had tacked? 'I am very glad now, that we\\nwore.\" Them five ships will rake\\nus to pieces. Blood, sir, or Blood and wounds, sir, what do\\nyou think the ships a-stern will be doing? if we\\nbear down, they will follow us. and satisfy'd with\\nour conduct, Mind, my good boys, and take\\ngood aim, and don't fire your shot in waste: for in\\nbearing down now, we shall have the five\\nsail all upon us. My lads, if\\nyou can hit them, do. I heard captain Norris propose to the master to bear\\ndown to attack the ship a-stern of the Spanish\\nadmiral, which the master objected to, saying,\\nthat we should have the fire of the five Spanish\\nships coming up. I heard our captain order the helm\\nto be put a-weather, and the jib to be hoisted,\\nand that we immediately wore ship; immediately we wore,\\nand kept a continual fire within about a musket\\nshot of the enemy a-stern of the Namur, and\\nto the leeward withal; if lieutenant Jekyll had acted like an officer,\\nwe might have gotten the vessels out which were\\nburnt at Casse; he sent me to set them on fire; for he\\nnever offered to go on board the vessels to see\\nthem set on fire, but kept in the boat under the\\nquarter of the said vessel, calling us to make\\nhaste to come away. Hugh Pallisser, first lieutenant of his \\nMajesty's ship the Essex, deposeth, That on\\nSaturday the 11th of February last, from the time\\nthe admiral made the signal to engage, 'till sunset,\\nthe Essex never was within gun-shot of the\\nenemy; for she hauled out of the line of battle when\\nthe Namur began the engagement, and then lay\\nto windward (at least gun-shot) of the line. The deponent further saith, That they began\\nto fire when the admiral did; but he judging\\nthat they were too far off, came up on the\\nquarter-deck to inform the captain thereof, who would\\nnot allow the deponent time to speak to him, but\\nordered him forward; saying, When the deponent\\nreturned again on the quarter-deck, he was\\nordered down by the captain, who said to him, as\\nhe was offering to speak, which the deponent\\naccordingly did, and found that by their having luffed so\\nmuch, none of the starboard guns could be brought\\nto bear on the enemy, upon which a mate came\\n\\ndown with orders to cease firing; and to point\\nthe metal aft. The deponent says, that also by\\nthe luffing they brought the Dorsetshire to bear\\nin the same manner as the enemy's ship did, and\\nthat some of the men mistook her for an enemy,\\nand fired at her, which the deponent observing,\\nstopped them 'till the smoak cleared away, and\\nthen discovered her blue ensign. In a short time\\nafter this, the deponent was sent for by the\\ncaptain, to ask his advice, whether it was not better\\nto stay where they were, than to bear down where\\nthere were five fresh ships of the enemy coming\\nup? The deponent, after desiring a little time to\\nlook round him, answered, that if they did not\\ngo down to the assistance of the Marlborough,\\nwhich then had lost her masts, she would\\ncertainly be destroy'd, or taken by them five ships.\\nThe deponent then looking about him, saw the\\nAnne Gally fire-ship going down towards the\\nReal, and then represented to the captain, the\\nimprobability of her ever doing any execution, if\\nsome ships did not go down to cover her from\\nthe aforesaid fireships, particularly the headmost,\\nwhose shot at that time flew very thick about\\nher. This the deponent often repeated, to which\\nthe captain as often replied, The deponent represented to captain\\nNorris, that if they would only bear down on the\\nReal as the Dorsetshire, they should do execution\\nupon her, as she was then going off in a disabled\\ncondition; but to this the captain made no\\nanswer, but seemed displeased with it.\\n   Some time after, Mr. Bentley, one of the\\nadmiral's lieutenants, came under the stern, and\\n\\ntold captain Norris, that if he did not bear down\\nto the assistance of the Marlborough, she would\\nbe lost; to which he made no direct answer, but\\nsaid, he should be tore to pieces. And the\\ndeponent then said to mr. Bentley, that captain\\nNorris seemed to which mr. Bentley\\nanswered, that he had been on board the Dorsetshire,\\nwhich was filling powder, and going down, and\\nthen went away; but the captain then whispered\\nthe deponent, That mr. Bentley did not say, it\\nwas the admiral's orders; to which the deponent\\nanswered, The deponent further saith, that after sinking\\nthe fire-ship they bore away a little, and that then\\nhe went to the captain to ask him, whether he\\nshould go down and try a single shot? to which\\nthe captain answered, Upon the\\ndeponent's firing one gun, the people were so eager\\nthat they fired several; upon which he received\\na message from the captain, at his peril to fire no\\nmore, for the shot fell short. After this some\\ntime, the deponent with the captain's leave try'd\\ntwo several shot, both which he himself saw\\nfall short. At this distance the deponent saith, they kept\\nfrom the enemy 'till sun-set, when the admiral\\nwore, and they followed him and fired upon the\\nenemy as they passed by them; which was the\\nonly time they were near enough to do\\nexecution. The deponent further saith, that for the whole\\nday, the captain never endeavoured to chear or\\nencourage the petty-officers and seamen to\\ndo their duty; but on the contrary appeared\\nwith a down-cast-dejected countenance, often\\n\\ncrying with a sigh, And\\nfurther this deponent saith not. HUGH PALLISSER. Sworn before me, on board\\nhis majesty's ship Essex,\\nJanuary 18, 1744.\\nJ. B. Morn. Dep. J. A. Hamilton Gore, third lieutenant of his\\nmajesty's ship the Essex, deposeth, That\\non Saturday the 11th of February last, the said\\nship under the command of captain Norris, never\\nwas within gun-shot of the enemy 'till the\\nevening; for the deponent often tried (as did several\\nof the ship's company) and found the shot always\\nfall short. He also addeth, that there was a\\ngeneral murmur among the men, because they\\ndid not go down to the assistance of the\\nMarlborough; and moreover saith, that they were to\\nwindward much, of all the ships in the admiral's\\ndivision. And further this deponent saith not. HAMILTON GORE. Sworn before me on board his\\nmajesty's ship the Essex,\\nJanuary 18, 1744.\\nJ. B. Morn. Dep. J. A. Joseph Peyton, fourth lieutenant of his\\nmajesty's ship the Essex, deposeth, That in the\\npreparations for the engagement which happen'd\\n\\nthe 11th of February last, captain Norris made\\nall the dispositions, and took all the precautions\\nthat became a good officer; but when the fleets\\nwere closing for action he was quite dispirited,\\nnever speaking but with a melancholy and\\ndejected tone, and shewing in all his actions the\\ngreatest signs of fear; of which the deponent is\\nthe more convinced, as he kept so far to\\nwindward of his station in the line of battle, not\\nbeing for the whole day within gun-shot of the\\nenemy. The deponent also saith, that when the\\nNamur and Marlborough bore down upon the Real,\\nthey in the Essex edged down a little, 'till they\\ncame about the distance of a random shot from\\nthe ship a-stern of the Spanish admiral, and then\\nbegan to fire. After they had fired for some\\ntime, the deponent saw the Marlborough's masts\\ngo away, upon which he went on the\\nquarter-deck to desire captain Norris to bear down to\\nher assistance; to which the he answered, (meaning the five sail in the rear of the Spanish\\nsquadron) The deponent then said, The\\nMarlborough was in the greatest danger of those\\nfive sail; and that if the Essex bore down to her\\nshe could be of great service to her. The\\ncaptain then sent for mr. Pallisser to ask his advice;\\nbut while he was looking about to see the\\ndisposition of the enemy, mr. Bentley, one of the\\nadmiral's lieutenants came under the stern, and\\ndesired captain Norris to bear down to the assistance\\nof the Marlborough; to which he answer'd, The deponent does not\\nremember what mr. Bentley said to this, only\\nthat he shrugg'd his shoulders and went away. The deponent saith, that he has but a\\nconfused idea of what happened till they wore after\\nthe admiral, and as they haul'd the wind on the\\nstarboard-tack, captain Norris came into the\\nweater-gangway, and stooping under the shelter of\\nthe hammocks, called out to the deponent, for\\nGod's sake to mind sails, expressing in all his\\nbehaviour the utmost terror; but this being the\\nfirst time the men were within point blank of the\\nenemy, their order was such, the deponent could\\nnot get them from the guns, but was oblig'd to\\ntake the marines from off the forcastle, to haul\\nthe fore-bow-line, because the captain was most\\nuneasy about the fore-sail, as it shook in the\\nwind. The deponent further saith, that he often\\ncast his eyes upon the captain, and to the best\\nof his remembrance, he never stood erect, or\\nleft the place where he was 'till the firing ceased,\\nnor ever encouraged the people, or shewed any\\nmarks of the commander; but on the contrary,\\nput on a short shooting-jacket, and one of the\\npurser's leather caps. And further this deponent\\nsaith not. JOSEPH PEYTON. Sworn before me, on board his majesty's ship\\nthe Essex, the 18th of Jan. 1744.\\n   J. B. Morn. Dep. J. A. Joseph Myers, master of his majesty's ship\\nEssex, deposeth, That on the morning of the\\n11th of February last, after the admiral had\\nmade the signal to engage, captain Norris shew'd\\nall the signs of the utmost fear and dejection; and\\nupon the deponent singing the famous\\nNinety-two, the captain said, and\\nthen walked about sighing, and shewing in his\\nface the greatest confusion; and\\nnotwithstanding an officer came from the admiral between\\neight and nine o'clock in the morning, with\\ndirections to him to keep the line as close as\\npossible, yet after the action began, till sun-set, he\\nnever was in the line. The deponent sayeth, that after the admiral\\nbegan the engagement, captain Norris said to\\nhim, to which the\\ndeponent said, Then the captain\\nedged down a little and began to fire, but\\npresently after sprung his luff, which the deponent\\nseeing, and that the shot fell short, told the\\ncaptain that it was heaving powder and shot over\\nboard to fire any longer, and could answer no\\npurpose; and upon his telling him so a second\\ntime he ordered all firing to cease, and then lay\\na considerable distance to windward of his station;\\nthe Dorsetshire and Rupert, the ships a-head\\nand a-stern, being a great way to leeward of\\n\\nAN ERRONEOUS PAGE NUMBER IN SOURCE TEXT: 37\\nthem. When they had laid thus some time, the\\ncaptain ordered a gun to be laid down, to see\\nwhether it could reach the enemy, and seeing it\\ndid not, try'd a second, but to no purpose, they\\nboth falling short. Then seeing the Ann galley\\nfire-ship bearing down upon the Real, the\\ncaptain sent for Mr. Pallisser to advise with him,\\nwhat was best to be done; who, after he had\\nlooked about him, answered, that if they did\\nnot go down to cover the fire-ship, she must be\\nsunk by the headmost of those fire-ships\\ncoming up; upon which the captain turned away\\nfrom mr. Pallisser, nor does the deponent\\nremember that he gave him any answer. The deponent farther says, that in the close\\nof the evening when the admiral wore down\\namong the enemy, the captain ordered him to\\ntack, which the deponent, said Then he ordered the helm a-weather; As\\nsoon as the ship was wore, and the yards\\nbraced, the deponent turned himself to the\\nmen at the guns, who continued firing, till they\\npassed the enemy, which when they had done,\\nhe went a-cross to the captain in the starboard\\ngangway, and told him all the enemy's shot fell\\na-stern of them. He then came out of the\\ngangway, and the deponent said to him The\\ncaptain said, The deponent further saith, that during the\\ntime they were running past the enemy, he never\\nsaw the captain on the quarter-deck, but\\n\\nalways in the starboard gangway couching under\\nthe hammocks. And that further this deponent\\nsaith not. J. MYERS. Sworn before me on board his majesty's ship\\nEssex, January 18, 1744.\\n   J. B. Morn. Dep. J. A. William Sutherland, lieutenant of marines on\\nboard his majesty's ship the Essex, deposeth,\\nThat in the engagement on the 11th of February\\nlast, he observed, that all the shot which they\\nfired, till the time they wore after the admiral\\nin the evening, fell short of the enemy, the\\nEssex being a considerable distance to windward\\nof the Dorsetshire and Rupert, the ships next\\na-head and a-stern of her; that when the\\nMarlborough lost her masts, the men on the forecastle\\n(where the deponent commanded) were quite\\nmutinous, because they could not go down to\\nher assistance. The deponent further saith, that, whenever\\nhe observed captain Norris, he appeared in the\\nutmost confusion and quite dispirited. And\\nfurther this deponent saith not. WILLIAM SUTHERLAND. Sworn before me on board his majesty's ship\\nEssex, in Mahon harbour the 18th of\\nJanuary, 1744.\\n   J. B. Morn. Dep. J. A.

The deponent further saith, that the captain\\nlooked quite dispirited, and that he used no\\nmanner of means to encourage or hearten the\\npeople; and further this deponent saith not. JAMES STEWART.

Lieutenant-colonel Crosbie, of the honourable\\ncolonel Graham's regiment on foot,\\nvoluntarily maketh oath, That on the 11th of\\nFebruary last, the day of the fleet's engagement off\\nToulon, he was on board his majesty's ship the\\nEssex, captain Richard Norris commander; that\\n\\nthe deponent was not off of the said ship's\\nquarter deck during the whole time of the\\nengagement, but was constantly with the said captain\\nNorris, and therefore as well or better to judge\\nof his personal conduct as any other could be;\\nand this deponent maketh oath, That he did not\\nonce observe in captain Norris any signs of fear\\nor cowardice, but on the contrary, that he did,\\nto the best of this deponent's opinion, make a\\njust and good disposition in his ship for a\\ndefence against the enemy: That he gave all his\\norders in a distinct and punctual manner,\\nwithout confusion or sign of fear: That he (the\\ndeponent) did not once see captain Norris bob or\\nshelter himself in the gang-way, which he (the\\ndeponent) thinks is absolutely impossible for\\ncaptain Norris to have done, without his (the\\ndeponent's) notice, but on the contrary, to the best\\nof his knowledge and belief, captain Norris did\\nnot once quit the quarter-deck: That he did not\\nsee or hear lieutenant Jekyll, or any other officer,\\nuse any perswasion to captain Norris to bear\\ndown, which the deponent verily believes he must\\nhave heard, had any such been used. This\\ndeponent further declares, that just after the\\nMarlborough's being disabled, lieutenant Bentley came\\nunder the Essex stern, and proposed to captain\\nNorris to bear down, upon which he asked twice\\nover if it was the admiral's orders to bear\\ndown? and it was both times answered no. Capt.\\nNorris then desired lieut. Bentley to let a signal\\nbe made on board the Namur as soon as he got\\non board her, if it should be the admiral's\\npleasure for the Essex to bear down, (or words to\\n\\nthat purpose;) that then capt. Norris sent for his\\nlieutenants upon the quarter-deck, and asked\\ntheir opinions concerning bearing down, and\\nthat the said lieutenants were of opinion that capt.\\nNorris could not break the line, unless the signal\\nwas made from the admiral for him so to do. This deponent further saith, that he has read\\na copy of a letter said to be sent to admiral\\nMatthews from lieut. Jekyll, and that the aspersions\\nthrown on capt. Norris in the said letter, are, in\\nthis deponent's judgment, scandalous, false,\\ngroundless, and malicious. And this deponent\\nfurther saith, that he did not see or hear of any\\nmurmuring, or discontent, either among the\\nofficers or company of the said ship, upon any\\naccount; but on the contrary all the lieutenants\\nwere in a good harmony with capt. Norris, as\\nwell the day before as after the engagement, and\\nas long as he, this deponent, continued on\\nboard: And this deponent further adds, that a\\nday after the engagement lieut. Pallisser went on\\nboard the admiral's ship, and on his return was\\nasked by the deponent how the admiral did, as\\nit was feared by some people that the admiral\\nwas dead; and lieut Pallisser reply'd, that he\\n(the admiral) was very well, meaning the Essex's, or words to\\nthat purpose.

John Brown, a first lieutenant of the\\nhonourable colonel Powlett's regiment of marines,\\nmaketh oath, That he commanded a\\ndetachment of the said marines, on board his\\nmajesty's ship the Essex, on the 11th of February\\nlast, the day of engagement off of Toulon; and\\nthat capt. Richard Norris, commander of the\\nsaid ship, did, to the best of this deponent's\\njudgment, make a good and just disposition of\\nhis officers and men, in order for a defence\\nagainst the enemy; and did, during the whole\\ntime of the engagement, carefully and\\npunctually deliver his orders to his officers; nor did\\nthis deponent once observe the said capt.\\nNorris to quit the deck, or bob, or shew any signs\\nof fear or cowardice, but on the contrary, he\\nbehaved, to the best of this deponent's judgment,\\nlike a soldier and a man of honour. And this\\ndeponent further saith, that altho' captain Norris\\nand himself were not upon the footing he, the\\ndeponent, could have wished, yet he thinks himself\\nobliged to declare that the aspersions thrown on\\ncapt. Norris, in a letter said to be sent by lieut.\\nJekyll to admiral Mathews, are, in his opinion,\\nunjust, cruel, and malicious. John Brown.

Moses Ferrin. boatswain's mate of his\\nmajesty's ship Essex, maketh oath, That on the\\n11th day of February last, the day of the\\nengagement off cape Seicie, being quarter'd\\ncaptain of the first gun, and its opposite on the\\nquarter-deck; that captain Norris, in the\\nbeginning of the action, encourag'd the whole ship's\\ncompany to behave like Englishmen; and gave\\nthe first lieutenant orders to keep the people to\\ntheir quarters, and if any deserted them, to cut\\nthem down: that the said captain behaved the\\nwhole time of the engagement with great\\ncourage and conduct, and without the least shew\\nof fear or cowardice, nor was the least confus'd;\\nbut issued his orders in a brave, undaunted \\nmanner, and frequently spoke to us at our quarters\\nto this intent; that he heard captain Norris speak to the\\nmaster, to the intent to bear down and engage the\\nSpanish ship under the Real's lee-quarter; but the\\nmaster (who was then standing on the heel of\\nthe top-mast in the booms, and looking at our\\nfleet a-stern) objected to it, saying, it was better to\\nstay till mr. Lestock was come up; he said, He further declares, That when admiral\\nMathews bore down in the evening he heard\\ncaptain Norris order the helm a-weather, to\\nhoist the jib, and ware-ship; and says, he never\\n\\nheard any orders given by the captain during\\nthe whole action, to tack ship, nor did perceive\\nthe least motion made for that purpose: that\\nwhen admiral Mathews bore down, we did the\\nsame after him, and kept a continual fire at the\\nenemy till dark, being then about musquet-shot\\nfrom the enemy; that at the same the master\\ncall'd him away from his quarters, telling him,\\nthat he must fire no more, for he could not hit\\nthe enemy: the captain then said, This deponent further\\nsays, that he did not see lieutenant Jekyll upon\\nthe quarter-deck the whole time of the action;\\nbut that he observ'd him to say to the people\\nthat were quarter'd to the guns on the upper\\ndeck about him, to the best of my remembrance,\\nthat he was 32 years old, but that he did not\\nknow he should live to see the engagement out;\\nat the same time he said, mr. Jekyll look'd much\\ndejected, and stood in a fearful posture, with his\\nsword pointed to the deck; that the said\\nlieutenant Jekyll's letter to admiral Mathews against\\ncaptain Norris is entirely false and malicious,\\nand done only with a design of endeavour to\\nprejudice him. And further saith not. MOSES FERRIN. Die 10 Jan. 1745.\\nJuravit & firmavit coram me,\\nOlivar & Pardo, com. vice-admiral. \\n   WILL. ROWLEY. John Gillespy, quarter-master of his majesty's\\nship Essex, maketh oath, That on the 11th of\\nFeb. last, the day of the engagement off Toulon,\\nhe was quartered to the cunn on board the same\\nship, and when the signal was made to engage,\\ncapt. Norris, commander of the said ship,\\nencourag'd them all to behave as Englishmen, and the\\nwhole time of the engagement behaved with\\nbravery and composure, and issued his orders in\\na punctual manner without confusion, or shewing\\nany signs of fear or cowardice; that the\\nsaid That when admiral Mathews bore down in\\nthe evening, and that\\ncaptain Norris did not shew the least intention or\\ninclination to tack, which mr. Jekyll falsely\\naccuses him with; and that neither did captain Norris\\nmake any sail to get off, but continued firing till\\nnight put an end to the engagement. This deponent further saith, That the said\\ncaptain Norris did not, during the engagement\\n\\nshelter himself in the gangway, which place was\\nworse barricaded than any other upon deck, and\\nthe worst place in the ship above the upper\\ndeck that a man could fly to for shelter; that\\nthere were but two tires of hammocks, those\\nvery indifferently stowed, and much settled by\\npeople's footing on them to get up the main\\nshrouds. That he neither saw lieutenant Jekyll\\nor any other person go to, or perswade captain\\nNorris to bear down, nor did he observe any\\nmurmuring or discontent among the people. And it is the opinion of the said deponent,\\nthat and that when lieutenant Jekyll\\nwas sent to set fire to the said vessels, the said deponent, And this deponent further saith, that the\\naspersions thrown on captain Norris, by a letter\\nsaid to be sent by lieutenant Jekyll to admiral\\nMathews, are very unjust, false, and malicious.\\nAnd further saith not.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In January last I went to see Mrs.\\nJohnston , who then lived at the Prisoner's\\nHouse: Her Husband brought me over\\nfrom Ireland ; upon which Account I\\nwanted to speak with her. I found her at\\nhome, and we drank a Quartern of\\nHolland's Gin together. By and by in comes\\nMrs. Murphy with a Pair of Brocaded\\nShoes and Clogs, and makes a Present of\\nthem to Mrs. Wilde . The Prisoner was\\nin Company. We drank two or three\\nQuarterns more, and then I and Mrs.\\nMurphy got up to go away together. The\\nPrisoner ask'd me which way I was\\ngoing? I told him to my Lodgings at the\\nSeven Dials. I suppose you go Holborn Way ,\\nsays he. We answer'd, Yes . Why then ,\\nsays he, I'll tell ye what; -- There's an\\nold Blind Bitch that sells fine Flanders Lace\\njust by Holborn-Bridge; her Daughter is as\\nblind as herself; and if ye call there, you may\\nspeak with a Box of Lace (that is, steal a \\nBox.) -- I'll go along with ye, and shew\\nye the Door.  So the Prisoner and I and\\nMurphy went together, till we came\\nwithin Sight of the Door: He pointed and\\n\\nshew'd us which it was, and said he would\\nwait for us, and bring us off, if any\\nDisturbance should happen. Murphy and I\\nwent in, and turn'd over a great deal of\\nLace, but could see none that would please\\nus, not a Piece that was broad enough,\\nand fine enough; for it was our Business\\nto be very nice and difficult. At last, the\\nold Woman stept up Stairs to fetch\\nanother Piece: And as People of our\\nProfession are seldom guilty of losing an\\nOpportunity, I made use of this. I took a\\nTin Box of Lace, gave it to Mrs. Murphy ,\\nand she hid it under her Cloak. The old\\nWoman came down with another Box,\\nand shew'd us several Pieces, for which\\nshe asked 6 s. a Yard. We offer'd her 4 s.\\nand not being likely to agree about the\\nPrice, we came away, and found the\\nPrisoner waiting where we left him. We\\ntold him what Success we had had, and\\nso went back with him to his House.\\nThere we open'd the Box, and found\\nEleven Pieces in it. He ask'd us if we\\nwould have ready Money, or stay till an\\nAdvertisement came out. Stock being\\npretty low with us at that time, we chose the\\nfirst, and so he gave us three Guineas and\\nfour Broad Pieces. I took for my Share\\nthree Guineas and a Crown, and Mrs.\\nMurphy had the rest. I can't afford to give you\\nany more , (says he) for though I have got\\nsome Influence over her, by helping her to\\nGoods two or three times before, yet I know\\nher to be a stingey hard-mouth'd old Bitch,\\nand I shan't get above Ten Guineas out of\\nher . THE READING OF THE CLAUSE OMITTED. On the 22d of January ,\\nbetween Three and Four in the Afternoon,\\na Man and a Woman came into my Shop,\\nunder Pretence of buying some Lace:\\nThey were so very difficult, that I had none\\nbelow that would please them; and so,\\nleaving my Daughter in the Shop, I stept\\nup Stairs, and brought down another Box.\\nWe could not agree about the Price, and\\nso they went away together; and in about\\nhalf an Hour after I miss'd a Tin Box\\nof Lace, that I valu'd at 50 l. The same\\nNight, and the next, I went to Jonathan\\nWilde's House; but not meeting with him,\\nI advertised the Lace that I had lost, with\\n\\na Reward of 15 Guineas, and no Questions\\nask'd. But hearing nothing of it, I went\\nto Jonathan's House again, and then met\\nwith him: He desired me to give him a\\nDescription of the Persons that I suspected,\\nwhich I did as near as I could; and then\\nhe told me that he'd make Enquiry, and\\nbid me call again in two or three days.\\nI did so; and then he said, that he had\\nheard something of my Lace, and\\nexpected to know more of the Matter in a\\nlittle Time. I came to him again on the\\nDay that he was apprehended, (I think\\n'twas the Fifteenth of February .) I told\\nhim, that though I had advertised but\\nFifteen Guineas Reward, yet I wou'd give\\nTwenty or Twenty-five rather than not\\nhave my Goods. Don't be in such a\\nHurry , says he; I don't know but I may help\\nyou to it for less; and if I can, I will.\\nThe Persons that have it, are gone out of\\nTown; I shall set them to quarrelling about\\nit, and then I shall get it the cheaper .  On\\nthe Tenth of March , he sent me Word,\\nthat if I would come to him in Newgate ,\\nand bring Ten Guineas in my Pocket, he\\ncould help me to my Lace. I went: He\\ndesired me to call a Porter; but I not\\nknowing where to find one, he sent a\\nPerson who brought one that appeared to\\nbe a Ticket Porter. The Prisoner gave\\nme a Letter, which he said was sent him\\nas a Direction where to go for the Lace;\\nbut I could not read, and so I deliver'd\\nit to the Porter. Then he desired me to\\ngive the Porter Ten Guineas, or else (he\\nsaid) the Persons that had the Lace would\\nnot deliver it. I gave the Porter the\\nMoney; he went away, and in a little Time\\nreturn'd, and brought me a Box that was\\nseal'd up, but not the same that was lost.\\nI open'd it, and found all my Lace but\\none Piece. Now, Mr. Wilde, (says I) \\nwhat must you have for your Trouble? Not\\na Farthing , says he; not a Farthing for\\nme. I don't do these things for Worldly\\nInterest, but only for the Good of the poor\\nPeople that have met with Misfortunes. As\\nfor the Piece of Lace that is missing, I hope\\nto get it for you e'er be long; and I don't\\nknow but that I may help you not only to\\nyour Money again, but to the Thief too; and\\nif I can, much good may't do you. And as\\nyou're a good Woman and a Widow, and a\\nChristian, I desire nothing of you but your\\nPrayers, and for them I shall be thankful. I\\nhave a great many Enemies, and God knows\\nwhat may be the Consequence of this\\nImprisonment . Suppose now, that there\\nwas but one Person concern'd in such a\\nCase; can it be thought that ever the\\nLegislature intended that this Person\\nshould apprehend himself, bring himself\\n\\nto Tryal, give Evidence against himself,\\nconvict himself, and hang himself? No,\\ncertainly. He was indicted by the Name\\nof Jonathan Wilde , of the\\nParish of S. Andrew's Holborn , for\\nprivately stealing, in the Shop\\nof Katharine Stetham , 50 Yards of Lace,\\nValue 40 l. the Goods of the said Katharine\\nStetham , on the 22d of January 1724-5. He was a Second Time indicted, for that\\nwhereas 50 Yards of Lace, Value 40 l.\\nwas privately stolen in the Shop of\\nKatharine Stetham , by Persons unknown, on\\nthe said 22d of January , he the said\\nJonathan Wilde , on the 10th of March\\nfollowing, did feloniously receive of the said\\nKatharine Stetham Ten Guineas, on\\nAccount and under Colour of helping the\\nsaid Katharine Stetham to the said Lace\\nagain; and did not then, nor any time\\nsince, discover or apprehend, or cause to\\nbe apprehended and brought to Justice,\\nthe Persons that committed the said\\nFelony. The Prisoner, in the Morning before\\nhis Tryal came on, dispersed about the\\nCourt a considerable Number of printed\\nLists of the Felons that he had \\napprehended, which concluded in these Words;\\nIn regard therefore of the Numbers above\\nConvicted, some that have yet escaped\\nJustice are endeavouring to take away the Life\\nof the said Jonathan Wilde. This\\nextraordinary Proceeding gave Occasion to the\\nKing's Counsel to observe, That such\\nPractices were unwarrantable, and not to\\nbe suffer'd in any Court of Justice: That\\nthis was apparently intended to take off\\nthe Credit of the King's Witnesses, and to\\nprepossess and influence the Jury. But as\\nhe believed them to be Men of Integrity,\\nhe was under no Apprehensions that it\\nwould have such an Effect: Nor, on the\\ncontrary, could he suppose that they would\\ngive any other than a conscientious\\nVerdict, according to Evidence, tho' the\\nindirect Management of the Prisoner was far\\nfrom making his Cause appear favourable:\\nThat it was impossible that a Man that\\nhad carry'd on a Trade of Felony for so\\nmany Years past; a Man that had bred up\\n\\nand erected a Corporation of Felons; a\\nMan, whose constant known Practice had\\nbeen to procure Goods that have been\\nlost in any Part of the Town; that it\\nwas impossible that such a Man should\\nnot have it in his Power to detect those\\nFelons: And yet there was good Reason\\nto believe, that (to the great Scandal of\\npublick Justice) he had on the contrary\\nterrify'd many from Reformation, and\\nprevented them from making such\\nDiscoveries as might have been of publick\\nAdvantage: That if a strict Enquiry was to\\nbe made into the Motives of his\\napprehending those Criminals named in his List,\\nwe should find that they were private\\nInterest, old Grudges, or fresh Quarrels, and\\nnot the least Regard to Justice and his\\nCountry, &c . The Prisoner pray'd that the Witnesses\\nagainst him might be examin'd apart;\\nwhich the Court granted. Henry Kelly (being sworn) deposed thus: Margaret Murphy deposed the same;\\nand Katharine Stetham corroborated that\\nPart of their Depositions which related to\\ntheir being in her Shop; and added, that\\nshe miss'd the Lace in about half an Hour\\nafter they were gone. The Evidence was\\nfull and positive against the Prisoner. But here his Counsel (who waited in\\nreadiness if any Point of Law should arise)\\nstood up, and beg'd Leave to declare it\\nas their Opinion, that the Defendant,\\naccording to the Evidence given against him,\\ncould not be guilty of the Indictment;\\nand their Reason for it was, that the\\nIndictment sets forth, That HE did\\nprivately steal this Lace (IN) the Shop; when it\\nwas certain that he did not enter the Shop:\\nThat he might indeed be guilty of a simple\\nFelony, in being Accessory before the Fact,\\nor in Receiving the Goods after; but\\ncould not be guilty of the Capital\\nOffence, except (according to the Act) it had\\nbeen inserted in the Indictment, that He\\ndid Assist, Hire or Command . The Court,\\nin summing up the Evidence, observed to\\nthe Jury, that in Felonies, Burglaries, and\\nRobberies on the Highway, every \\n\\nAccessory before the Fact is a Principal; he that\\nstands by, or watches at a Distance,\\nbeing as guilty, and as liable to the same\\nPunishment, as the very Man that enters\\nthe House, or steals the Money or Goods.\\nBut as it was not remembred that there\\nhad yet been any Precedent, of the like\\nConstruction being put upon Indictments\\nof this Nature, it remained as a Matter of\\nDoubt; and therefore, in such Cases, it\\nwas most eligible to incline to the Side of\\nMercy. The Second Indictment against Jonathan\\nWilde was upon the following Clause in\\nan Act passed in the 4th Year of the Reign\\nof his Majesty King George I. which was\\nread in Court, viz. Katharine Stetham (being sworn)\\ndeposed thus: The Prisoner said nothing in his\\nDefence, but that he had convicted a great\\nNumber of Criminals; only he desired\\n\\nthat Murphy and Kelly might be called\\nin again, which was granted. Then (this\\nIndictment being laid for helping\\nKatharine Stretham to Goods that had been\\nstolen from her by Persons UNKNOWN)\\nhe pray'd, that Murphy might be ask'd\\nwho stole the Lace? In Expectation, that\\nshe would unwarily swear, that herself\\nand Kelly were the Persons; (for though\\nsuch Evidence was given in the former\\nTryal, the Law could take no Notice\\nof it in this, except it had been sworn\\nover again.) But the Court inform'd\\nhim, that as Murphy was an Evidence\\nupon Oath, no body could require her\\nto answer any Questions to accuse\\nherself. Then he pray'd the Court would\\nask her, if he (the Prisoner) stole the\\nLace? To which she answer'd, No; but\\nhe was concerned with those that did\\nsteal it, and he received it after it was\\nstolen . From hence the Counsel for the\\nPrisoner beg'd Leave to observe, That as\\nMurphy had sworn that the Prisoner was\\nguilty of Felony, they presumed that the\\nAct upon which he was now indicted,\\nwas never intended to affect him, or\\nany other Felon, but only such Persons\\nthat were not Felons themselves, but hold\\na Correspondence with Felons. For as\\nthere were old Laws in Force for the\\nPunishment of Felons, it would have been\\naltogether unnecessary that a new Law\\nshould be made to the same Purpose, --\\nthat is, to no Purpose at all. -- That\\nthe very Preamble to that Clause of the\\nAct upon which the Prisoner was\\nindicted, intimates, by a plain Distinction, that\\nFelons are not in that Place intended.\\nThe Words are thus: \"Whereas there\\nare several Persons who have secret\\nAcquaintance with Felons , and who\\nmake it their Business to help Persons\\nto their stolen Goods, and by that\\nmeans gain Money from them, which\\nis divided between THEM and the\\nFELONS.\" -- That by a Proviso\\nin the said Clause, it could not be\\nsupposed that Felons were there intended,\\nwithout making Contradictions and\\nInconsistencies in the Act itself. For the\\nWords are, \"Unless such Person doth\\napprehend, or cause to be\\napprehended, such Felon who stole the same,\\nand cause such Felon to be brought to a\\nTryal for the same, and give Evidence\\nagainst him.\" To this the Counsel for the Crown\\nreply'd to the following Effect, That it\\nwas no Absurdity or Contradiction to\\nsay, that that Act was intended to\\naffect Felons, even in a Case where there\\nwas but one Felon concern'd: For that\\na Man's being a Felon, did not any way\\nhinder him from discovering his\\nAccomplices, if he had any; and if he had\\nnone, but committed the Offence by\\nhimself, it would be impossible to try him for\\ntaking Money upon Account of restoring\\nGoods that were stolen, till he was first\\nconvicted of stealing those Goods: And\\nthis first Conviction would then be\\nsufficient. There would be no Necessity for\\ntrying him for the other Offence; for\\nif he was found guilty, it would make\\nno Alteration in his Punishment: But\\nthat this was not the Case of the\\nPrisoner: That it was evident that he had\\nAccomplices, and had not discover'd them.\\nThe Court farther observ'd, that Felons\\nwere so far from being excepted in that\\nAct, that it was principally intended\\nagainst then; for it particularly\\nmentions, \"Those that make it their\\nBusiness to help People to stolen Goods.\"\\nAnd it was certain, that such Persons\\n\\nmust be Receivers of stolen Goods,\\nknowing them to be stolen, and such are\\nFelons. That the Case of the Prisoner came\\nwithin almost every Circumstance of the\\nAct; it being evident that he was a\\nPerson that had secret Acquaintance with\\nFelons, who made it his Business to help\\nPeople to stolen Goods, and by that\\nmeans gain'd Money from them; which\\nwas divided betwixt him and the Felons, \\nand thereby greatly encouraged such\\nOffenders, and had not apprehended them.\\nThat it was a very surprizing Plea for a\\nMan to say, I am more guilty than you\\nare aware of, and therefore I ought to\\nsuffer less: And that it could not be\\nthought that the Parliament ever intended\\nby this Act to excuse a Man meerly\\nbecause he was a Felon, and more Criminal\\nthan another. The Jury acquitted the Prisoner of the\\nfirst Indictment, and found him Guilty of\\nthe other.  \n",
